Professor Name: Ali ABBAS
=====================================================================================================
Professor Ali Abbas' research in Process Systems Engineering aims at increasing our understanding of multi-scalar processes - from the workings of power plants to those of the human body - enabling us to enhance them in methodical ways for the benefit of our health and that of our environment.
"I am interested in understanding the intricate behaviour of systems and how they work at multiple scales in chemical process industries and in biomedical systems.
"Two key areas I am currently tackling are low-emissions technologies and biomedical stem cell therapy.
"In a fossil-fuelled power plant, for example, fuel such as coal or gas is combusted to generate steam, which turns turbines, which in turn rotate generators to produce the electricity we use every day. Such a power plant consists of numerous subsystems - including the boiler, the turbines, the steam cycle and the exhaust system - all of which must work together harmoniously to ensure reliable electricity production.
"Similarly, the human body comprises many systems intricately working together, and I believe that the only way to resolve biomedical problems is to understand how the body's systems cooperate together at different scales - from genes to cells to tissues to organs to bodily systems.
"This research has recently led to systematic methods to compute working fluids and materials having targeted properties that maximise the performance of processes, such as heat transfer fluids in heat pipes used in solar collectors; refrigerants in liquefied natural gas (LNG) processes; solvents in carbon capture processes; and membranes with optimal material properties required to carry out the most difficult gas separations, such separating hydrogen from nitrogen, both having similar molecular size and shape.
"I am very passionate about knowledge, science and learning, and am always working to foster this passion in students and in the community. My goal is to have my research translate into real technologies and solutions, demonstrating its relevance to society and to solving real problems.
"For example, my research into low-emissions technologies looks at how we can continue to use fossil fuels in more sustainable ways that do less harm to our environment, such as through carbon-capture technologies or the hybridisation of fossil power with renewable energy systems.
"My research in biosystems engineering aims at optimising processes for stem cell culturing that lead to therapeutic solutions for people with chronic diseases, such as leukaemia.
"My journey at the University of Sydney started as a student in 1997; I completed both my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees here, and have been an academic staff member here since 2007. This great institution means a lot to me, because it has given me a lot of opportunity. Throughout my education I had tremendous mentors, whose passion for education and research continues to inspire my own aspirations in education and research."

Professor Name: David AIREY
=====================================================================================================
Humans have been erecting buildings for millennia, but our understanding of the behaviour of the soil and rock on which they rest is still relatively poor. Professor David Airey's research aims to improve our understanding of the ground's response to construction and excavation so we can better assess the risks, reduce costs and build longer-lasting infrastructure.
"Everyone is affected by failure to properly understand soil and rock behaviour. For example, if excavations carried out as part of construction project result in a burst water main, this can cause disruptions to traffic and commuter chaos for days. Such a scenario might be avoidable if we had a better understanding of soil behaviours.
"I also work on the evaluation of various ground improvement methods that are used to make the ground more stable.
"As well as buildings on land, my work has applications to offshore structures such as oil and gas platforms. The sand beneath these platforms can be made up of different particles from soils on land, including coral particles, making them behave differently. Understanding these soil types and their behaviours is crucial when sinking the foundations for these structures and ensuring that they'll be stable and safe.
"One of the challenges of working with underground behaviours is that they're all hidden - they're out of sight, and usually out of mind. So my ultimate goal is to develop models that can effectively 'see' into the soil and, combined with other instruments, allow us to truly understand what's going on under the ground."
David Airey graduated from the University of Cambridge in 1979 with a BA in Engineering and stayed on to complete Masters and PhD degrees in Soil Mechanics. He took up a position as a research fellow at the University of Western Australia in 1987, and moved to the University of Sydney in 1989. Professor Airey was Acting Head of School of Civil Engineering during 2016.
David Airey is on the editorial board of the Geotechnical Testing Journal, is a core member of TC29 a technical committee of the International Society for Geotechnical and Foundation Engineering concerned with pre-failure behaviour of geomaterials, and is a committee member of the Australian Geomechanics Society.

Professor Name: Ali ANAISSI
=====================================================================================================
The ongoing safety of built structures such as buildings and bridges relies on the early identification of any damage. But most approaches to maintenance are time-based, scheduling inspections only at predetermined intervals of time. Dr Ali Anaissi’s research aims to convert this procedural convention to a condition-based approach, whereby continuous monitoring of a structure by networked sensors would detect early signs of damage and trigger a responsive inspection.
“The condition-based approach that my research explores is known as structural health monitoring (SHM). It is a continuous automated process that aims to detect damage in a structure using data gathered from several networked sensors attached to it. In a structure such as a building or bridge, such early detection of damage is critical to avoid further risks to life, safety and economic loss.
“The main idea of this data-driven approach is for machine learning algorithms to ‘learn’ a model from the data sensed, in order to construct a baseline. This learned model is then applied to the new continuous real-time measurements being taken by the sensors, in order to generate real-time health scores for components of the structure by comparing the new measured responses to the established baseline.
“In this way my team and I have equipped the Sydney Harbour Bridge with a large number of networked sensors to provide information about the safety of the structure.
“We have also equipped a vehicle with sensors to collect vibration data during its journey on the roads, and then applied machine learning algorithms to assess the condition of those roads and detect any damage.
“I started working in the field of machine learning and data mining when I began my PhD in 2009, and later brought my research to the University of Sydney.”

=====================================================================================================
Professor Steve Armfield investigates the fluid mechanics of a range of environmental and industrial flows using computational, theoretical and experimental approaches, leading to applications as diverse as improved river management and the design of more efficient building ventilation systems.
"My main focus is on the development of computational models and algorithms to allow the prediction of highly unsteady, buoyancy-driven and -dominated flows, such as the natural convection boundary layers that develop adjacent to vertical heated surfaces, the two-layer mixing flow that occurs when a lighter fluid passes over a denser fluid, and thermal fountains and plumes.
"Such flows occur in many environmental and industrial settings, such as in rivers, estuaries and atmospheric boundary layers, and in building heating, cooling and ventilation.
"My research has made a substantial contribution to the understanding of the mechanism of flow initiation and transition, and has led to improved computational models for these flows that will inform the development of river management strategies, large-scale fluid dynamics models and the design of heating, ventilation and cooling systems.
"I joined the academic staff of the University of Sydney in 1996, having previously completed my PhD here. I was Head of the School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering from 2008 till 2015. I have held academic positions at other Australian universities as well as research positions in Japan and the US."

Research interests
Application of Radiative Cooling to Counteract Climate Change: In recent years, radiative cooling materials have seen significant development. I am interested in exploring and quantifying how the deployment of these materials can help counteract rising global temperatures.
Photonics for Energy Applications: Light plays a crucial role in energy technology. Among the latest developments are the photonic transformer to perform voltage conversion and the thermo-radiative energy harvesting to harvest energy from the emission of infrared radiation. Both technologies are still in their infancy stages of development and hold significant potential for future advancements.
Wireless Power Transfer: Wireless power transfer needs to be robust, efficient, and capable of long-range operation to be truly beneficial and practical. I am interested in exploring innovative designs that use new hardware configurations and advanced metamaterials to enhance these benefits, pushing the boundaries of what wireless power technology can achieve.
Dr Sid Assawaworrarit is Lecturer in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. He holds a prestigious Sydney Horizon Fellowship investigating the role of electromagnetics in addressing climate and energy challenges.
His research expertise is in the energy applications of electromagnetics – how can we efficiently and robustly move energy wirelessly; how can we envision the power converters in future electronic devices; and how can we harvest renewable energy out of the cold universe.
After his undergraduate studies at Caltech, Sid completed his Master’s degree and PhD in electrical engineering at Stanford University.
His research at Stanford has been internationally recognised. He invented a robust new method of wirelessly transferring power from a source to a moving device. This innovation opened a new direction in the field and received the award of 1% highly cited paper in physics from Web of Science.
In his postdoctoral research, Sid demonstrated that the coldness of the universe can serve as a source for renewable energy harvesting. His work on nighttime solar cell energy harvesting opens the door to all-day electricity generation from solar cells without relying on battery storage.
He was also part of the collaboration that pioneered a photonic transformer, a novel device design that uses light to convert one dc voltage to another. This innovative design offers a major advantage over conventional dc voltage converters by providing noiseless voltage conversion.

Professor Name: Michele BARNES
=====================================================================================================
A/Prof Barnes' research draws heavily on
sociology
and
social-ecological systems theory
to analyse the social structural and social-ecological foundations of individual, community, and organizational resilience in the context of climate change and other environmental risks. She has specialised expertise in
social network science
and
climate adaptation
, and she works on highly interdisciplinary projects that explore key issues such as: how social networks and social-ecological dynamics influence just and sustainable outcomes of adaptation and disaster resilience projects, how knowledge about climate change and other environmental issues spread through society, and how relationships among and between people and nature influence adaptive behaviour to environmental change. She also contributes to advancing network theory and methods.
Though the bulk of her work is focused on environmental change, A/Prof Barnes is interested in general environmental risks and other types of exogenous shocks that influence individual, community, and organizational resilience (such as COVID-19). She often leads large, international teams conducting primary research at different scales across the Indo-Pacific, e.g.
her work has focused on identifying gaps in collaborative networks of organizations involved in sustainability governance and the delivery of projects and programs to build resilience in the Western Indian Ocean, the Great Barrier Reef, and regional Queensland, Australia. Her work has also characterized how social networks and other social-ecological factors influence adaptive behavior among individuals, communities, and organizations in response to climate change and other types of shocks in East Africa and throughout the Indo-Pacific.”
In the past, A/Prof Barnes and her team have worked on questions related to sustainable fisheries and agriculture, diffusion of conservation interventions, co-management, illegal hunting, shark ecotourism, and regional environmental governance. Currently, they are studying social-ecological network dynamics and multiple outcomes associated with sustainability interventions over time; agency, power, and social structure in the context of sustainability and resilience projects; overlaps and gaps between peacebuilding and climate adaptation projects in practice; social-ecological systems approaches to disaster resilience; and developing theory and empirical evidence regarding the specific social structural patterns that provide resilience (and for whom) under different contexts and across scales.
Current research interests include
:
- climate change adaptation
- disaster resilience
- conservation and development interventions
- social determinants of adaptation/transformation (e.g. NetZero transitions)
- social networks, social-ecological networks
- social-ecological systems, human-nature interactions
- power dynamics
- social justice
- marine and coastal communities/industries
- Indo-Pacific region

Professor Name: David BOLAND
=====================================================================================================
One of the advantages of today’s personal computers is that they’re able to operate a wide range of different software programs. The flipside of this flexibility, however, is that any given software program is unlikely to make use of all the available hardware. Dr David Boland’s research focuses on this issue, with the aim of achieving faster and more energy-efficient computing.
“I study the computer algorithms used to solve problems across many domains, including scientific computing, machine learning and optical communications.
“I then consider how to design fully customised hardware solutions to these problems. In doing this I focus on how to perform as little computation as necessary, while still obtaining results as accurate as those produced by the original algorithm used in the software. This helps to maximise energy efficiency. I also look at how to do as much parallel computation as possible, in order to maximise performance.
“The technology to support this exists: we can already create application-specific integrated circuits, and we can use field-programmable gate arrays on which custom hardware designs can be programmed after manufacturing. However, designing customised hardware architectures is challenging, so is currently restricted to experts. I’m interested in making this performance more widely accessible.
“My research to date has largely focused on accelerating common computational kernels and basic arithmetic structures. I’m currently working on creating custom hardware accelerators for machine learning within the context of analysing wireless communication systems.
“The ability to perform fast analysis and prediction using this information could be critical for effective military operations, for example. High-performance and energy-efficient computation is also critical for the development and widespread use of novel technologies such as artificial intelligence, which could transform society. The challenge is to develop design techniques that are of benefit both now and in the future.
“I’ve been working in this field since 2007, and I joined the University of Sydney in 2017. The University has provided me with more opportunities to engage with industry and to work alongside like-minded colleagues to maximise the impact of my research.”
Dr. David Boland completed his MEng. and PhD. at Imperial College London in 2007 and 2012 respectively. He worked at Monash University as a lecturer from 2013 to 2016, before moving to the University of Sydney in 2017.

Professor Name: Athman BOUGUETTAYA
=====================================================================================================
Imagine you’re sitting at a cafe having coffee, when you notice your smartwatch is low on charge. What if you could recharge it wirelessly while you’re there – by having it scan the cafe for a suitable energy source, such as someone wearing smartshoes that have generated energy through friction as they walked to the cafe and can now make that energy available to charge your watch? Professor Athman Bouguettaya’s research aims to make this scenario possible.
“My research lies at the intersections of the internet of things (IoT), cloud computing and service computing. I see it in terms of a triangle, where the IoT is a way of collecting information, the cloud is a way of storing information, and service computing is a way of delivering information. I look at the places where any of these things meet, and then investigate how we can use the service computing paradigm to maximise the value of the IoT and cloud computing.
“One example is the concept of energy as a service that can be crowdsourced through the IoT, as illustrated above. Advantages include that it’s green, it doesn’t require any external energy source, and it’s much more efficient and convenient than our current model.
“Another example is leveraging the ubiquity of images and videos published on social media to enable detailed reconstruction and analysis of events such as crimes or accidents. This would be done using the spatiotemporal data automatically uploaded with any image file, to create a rich tapestry of visual and other information – timing, location, angle, lighting, sightlines, peripheral environment and so on – about a particular event.
“A third example is developing the use of drones as our primary means of goods delivery. This would increase efficiency and reliability and decrease costs and road congestion, by relying instead on optimal aerial delivery routes to rooftop delivery points across a CBD.
“I believe service computing can have a great impact on our lives, by enabling us to do a whole range of things better, faster and more effectively. I’ve been working in this field since the early 2000s, and I joined the University of Sydney in 2016, which has provided me with the right environment to do quality research as well as the best students to work with.”
Professor Athman Bouguettaya received his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Colorado at Boulder in the US in 1992. Before joining the University of Sydney as Professor and Head of the School of Computer Sciencein 2016, he was Professor and Head of the School of Computer Science and IT at RMIT University in Melbourne. Prior to this he was Science Leader in Service Computing at the CSIRO ICT Centre (now DATA61) in Canberra, and a tenured faculty member and program director in the Computer Science department at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) in the US.
Professor Bouguettaya is a founding member and past president of the Service Science Society, a non-profit organisation that aims to form a community of service scientists for the advancement of service science.
He has published more than 220 books, book chapters, journal articles and conference papers in the area of databases and service computing; he is currently editor-in-chief of the Springer-Verlag
Services Science
book series; and he has served as guest editor of a number of special issues of journals including

Professor Name: Graham BROOKER
=====================================================================================================
Radar systems provide an effective method of imaging the environment through rain, fog, dust, smoke or darkness, so are essential in vehicles that need to operate in dirty and potentially dangerous environments, such as in mining or military operations. Dr Graham Brooker's work in this field is providing a safer environment for people working in these fields. His parallel work in rehabilitation engineering is improving the quality of life of people living with dementia or Parkinson's disease.
"I love radar! There's something almost magical about being able to transmit insignificant amounts of power - less than that produced by a small torch - and receive echoes from targets that are kilometres away.
"As we work to improve the resolution and lower the cost of radar imaging, the technology will also become more commercially available in road vehicles, improving safety during times of poor visibility and ultimately reducing death and injury rates.
"With regard to rehabilitation engineering, my colleagues and I are currently working on a number of devices, including a system to investigate walking balance to identify vestibular diseases; an at-home test to evaluate people with Parkinson's disease; a birth simulator to help midwives learn how to rotate foetal heads and so minimise the requirement for caesarean sections; and a glasses-mounted device for people with dementia to identify where they are and prompt them to perform activities they might have forgotten, or to notify their carers about their activities.
“I’ve been a radar engineer for nearly 40 years, and have been working on rehabilitation devices for eight years. After working in industry for many years, I joined the University of Sydney in 1999. The work I’m doing here makes me feel that I’m making a real difference, improving the quality of life of thousands of members of our community.”

Professor Name: Julie CAIRNEY
=====================================================================================================
Professor Julie Cairney studies materials using advanced microscopy techniques that can image matter down to atomic scale. Their microstructure can then be related to their properties, and this knowledge can be used to engineer advanced materials with desirable properties such as superalloys, steels and hard coatings. In this way her work contributes to the development of stronger, lighter materials that require less energy to produce, for applications in industries like aerospace, construction and manufacturing.
"I love working with microscopes. In a parallel to astronomy, we're able to explore the unseen world of 'inner space' with the amazing scientific instrumentation available today. I think it's incredible that we can actually detect and visualise single atoms. To give some perspective, a single human hair is approximately the width of a million Carbon 12 atoms lying side by side.
"The structure of matter at atomic scale can tell us a lot about its performance in the real world. This information can then be used to develop new engineering materials such as high-wear alloys for longer-lasting parts that can save the mining industry millions of dollars in downtime costs, high-temperature materials that will enable the next generation of renewable energy technologies, thin-strip steels that require significantly less energy to produce, and exceptionally strong alloys with nanometre-sized grains.
"The successful manufacture of these materials will provide significant environmental as well as economic benefits, and they will have high-performance applications in a range of industries including aerospace, transport, construction, manufacturing, sports products, food and chemical processing, as well as in microelectromechanical and biomedical systems.
"I've been a materials researcher since completing my PhD in 2002, and joined the staff at the University of Sydney in 2005. My research relies heavily on being able to access world-class infrastructure for materials characterisation. Here at the Australian Centre for Microscopy and Microanalysis we have an outstanding array of state-of-the-art microscopes, as good as any of their kind in the world."
Professor Julie Cairney grew up in outback Australia in the town of Broken Hill. She studied Materials Science and Engineering at UNSW under a scholarship from Pasminco Limited (a former mining company based in Broken Hill). In 2002, she was awarded a PhD (Physical Metallurgy) also from UNSW. The next few years were spent working as a researcher at the University of Birmingham, UK and the
Max Planck Institute for Metals Research in Stuttgart, Germany
, before returning to Australia. She is currently working as a Professor in the School of
Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering
, is the Pro Vice-Chancellor (Research – Enterprise and Engagement) and is the CEO of

Professor Name: Fernando CALAMANTE
=====================================================================================================
Keywords
: MRI, Diffusion MRI, brain connectivity, machine learning, neuroscience.
Recent advances in MRI have revolutionised the way we investigate brain structure, brain function, and brain network connectivity, as well as how these are affected in disease. His lab's main research interests include: (1) the development and application of MRI methods to measure the blood delivery to brain tissue (with a technique known as
Perfusion MRI
), (2) the use of
Diffusion MRI
methods to map the structural connections in the brain (that is, the brain ‘wiring’), and (3) how to use this ‘wiring’ information to achieve
Super-resolution Imaging
(that is, creating images at higher resolution than that of the acquired image data).
In particular, Professor Calamante specialise in the development of the two main Perfusion MRI techniques: Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MRI (DSC-MRI) and Arterial Spin Labelling (ASL). The former is playing a key role in many clinical applications (such as in stroke and tumours), while the latter provides a powerful quantitative tool to characterise how the various brain regions are connected into functional networks. In turn, the technique of Diffusion MRI provides a unique means to reconstruct a representation of the white matter pathways in the brain (the ‘wiring’ of the brain), and thus to study non-invasively how the various brain regions are structurally connected into networks. Professor Calamante has also developed a super-resolution imaging approach, which provides a means to exploit the ‘wiring’ information obtained from Diffusion MRI to achieve image resolution not previously possible in the in vivo human brain non-invasively. This method not only can generate images with exquisite image detail, but also provides a new way to combine multi-modal imaging, such as structural and functional connectivity information, thus allowing an overall structural-functional description of the brain and its networks.
Novel connectivity methods can become essential tools in neuroscience, and should greatly contribute to further our understanding of brain networks in the healthy brain, and the effects of their disruptions in disease. These methods can provide new diagnostic markers, which are of great importance for understanding how the healthy brain functions, how healthy brain networks are perturbed by disease, and could help explain the effect of treatment.
Diffusion MRI methods to study brain structural connectivity
Professor Calamante’s and his colleagues have shown that the technique of Diffusion MRI can be used to obtain an estimate of the macroscopic white matter fibre orientations at each location in the brain, even in the presence of multiple fibre populations, which in turn can be used with a fibre-tracking algorithm to reconstruct a representation of the white matter pathways in the brain. For the case of whole-brain fibre-tracking, several million tracks (also known as streamlines) are generated, thus providing an overall representation of white matter pathways throughout the brain. The advanced analysis methods for Diffusion MRI developed by Prof. Calamante and colleagues have been released as an open access software tool (
MRtrix
), which has been widely used internationally.
Figure legend: whole-brain fibre-tracking data. (a) Human brain. (b) Mouse brain. The colour-coding indicates the local fibre orientation (red left–right, green dorsal–ventral, blue cranial–caudal).
Super-resolution MRI methods for the brain connectome
Professor Calamante and his team have shown that whole-brain diffusion MRI fibre-tracking data can be used to generate images with resolution higher than the resolution of the acquired data (i.e. to achieve ‘super-resolution’), with a technique they called super-resolution track-weighted imaging (TWI). This methodology provides a natural means to combine multi-modal imaging and, in particular, structural and functional connectivity information into a single image, and therefore can play a major role in the characterisation of the Brain Connectome (a comprehensive map of neural connections in the brain).
Novel MRI methods to study dynamic brain connectivity
Interest in the study of brain connectivity is growing, particularly in understanding the the structural/functional relation and how these two distinct forms of connectivity relate to each other. Recent studies demonstrated that dynamic characterizations of functional connectivity provide a more comprehensive description of functional brain networks. However, how these dynamic fluctuations influence the adaptive properties of neural information processing remains an open question that requires the development of new methods. One of the research interests of Calamante’s group is in the development of novel ways to investigate dynamic brain connectivity. For example, they recently developed the technique of track-weighted dynamic functional connectivity (TW-dFC), which fuses structural/functional connectivity data into a 4D image, providing a new approach to investigate dynamic connectivity. The structural connectivity information effectively ‘constrains’ the extremely large number of possible connections in the functional connectivity data (i.e. each voxel’s connection to each other), thus providing a way of reducing the problem’s dimensionality, while still maintaining key data features.
These methods can not only be used to study brain dynamics, but the connectivity information can also be exploited to perform data-driven parcellation of the brain. For example, Calamante’s group has recently demonstrated how the combination of structural connectivity, functional connectivity and dynamic connectivity can be exploited to parcellate the corpus callosum (one of the largest white matters structures in the human brain). This white matter parcellation can be subsequently used, in combination with Diffusion MRI fibre-tracking, to achieve cortical segregation. All these results are obtained in a data-driven way, without having to rely on a prior assumption of how the white matter or cerebral cortex is subdivided.
Figure legend: (a) Parcellation of the corpus callosum using TW-dFC and independent component analysis (mid-sagittal region); colours were arbitrarily chosen to aid visual differentiation. The cortical connections for the tracks traversing each of the white matter parcels are shown as a lateral sagittal slice (b) and viewed from above (c).
Perfusion MRI: novel methods to image cerebral blood flow and brain function
MRI provides a powerful non-invasive tool to measure the rate of blood delivery to brain tissue (also known as cerebral perfusion). Cerebral perfusion plays an essential role in tissue viability and function, and it is implicated in many diseases (such as stroke, epilepsy, and tumours). Professor Calamante is among the international leaders in the development of Perfusion MRI methods. He has been involved in the development of novel methods to measure and analyse Perfusion MRI data, with the aim to apply these methods to investigate brain disorders (including stroke, epilepsy and dementia). In particular, his work has had a direct impact on how Perfusion MRI is used for the clinical management of stroke. He has also shown that Perfusion MRI, using the technique known as Arterial Spin Labelling (ASL), can be a powerful tool to study brain functional connectivity and connectomics. Perfusion MRI has been shown to have a number of important advantages compared with more traditional BOLD fMRI methods to functional networks, including quantitation, reduced image distortions and signal drop-out, increased spatial specificity, and increased sensitivity to low task frequency paradigms.

Professor Name: Clement CANONNE
=====================================================================================================
Collecting, analysing, and processing large volumes of data, often high-dimensional, has become a centerpiece of modern computer science, machine learning, and industry at large. The time and memory constraints associated with these amounts of information present unprecedented challenges, as classical algorithms and statistical techniques are no longer sufficient to analyse the data. Further, new and even more stringent constraints have emerged, such as critical privacy concerns, or the physical limitations of battery- and communication-limited devices. Dr. Clément Canonne's research focuses on formalising those challenges, and developing sound theoretical foundations to address them.
"My research lies at the intersection of algorithms, information theory, statistics, and computational learning theory, and asks questions of the following flavour. When trying to perform a specific task on very large datasets, do we need exact answers or are approximate ones good enough? Must we store the data itself, or is some concise representation sufficient for our applications? Can interactivity or randomisation help reducing the computational load? What are the tradeoffs, if any, that one can achieve or must incur between privacy, speed, and accuracy?
"Overall, the goal is to analyse the fundamental and practical questions that emerge from the massive amounts of data available. I strive to develop new tools and techniques to analyse the many settings that arise, focusing not only on the purely statistical constraints at play, but also on the new computational and societal aspects that are now at the front and center of data science."
Dr Clément Canonne is a Senior Lecturer in the School of Computer Science, where he does research in theoretical computer science. His main research interests lie in property testing, learning theory, and, more generally, randomised algorithms and the theory of machine learning.
Prior to joining the University of Sydney, Clément was a Goldstine postdoctoral fellow at IBM Research Almaden, and a Motwani fellow at Stanford University. He obtained his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 2017.

Professor Name: Michel CHAAYA
=====================================================================================================
Successful project management requires a sound understanding of the field to which it is being applied. Dr Michel Chaaya's research into project management within the construction industry complements his practical work in that field, as he aims to identify innovative new ways of ensuring the successful delivery of building projects that will ultimately enhance community wellbeing.
"Project management is a global discipline, but its application requires experience in the field that is being managed. For example, you cannot effectively be a project manager for a construction project if you are not in the construction industry.
"I work in the industry and am a practical professional, and I enjoy the fact that my specialisation in different fields allows me to manage various aspects of a range of projects.
"The key factors for a success in any project are communication and risk management. These involve the 'soft' function of human behaviour, which is often misunderstood and needs to be considered in context.
"More specifically, ensuring the successful delivery of projects in the construction industry involves improving workplace processes, community services and ultimately community wellbeing.
"My work involves finding innovative ways of applying different techniques, including new sustainable methods of building (such as prefabricated rather than traditional), risk-management systems and integrated work-management systems. The results are always unexpected, and the excitement of waiting to see how things will turn out is always challenging. Also, with every project there are new stakeholders, so my job is never boring.
"The ultimate goal of my work is to facilitate better communication and understanding within the construction industry.
"I've been working in this field for 16 years, and joined the University of Sydney in 1995. The facilities here, and the teaching and research environment, have greatly assisted my research."
Dr Michel Chaaya is globally known for his expertise in successfully managing and delivering complex projects.
Since 2008, Michel has played the role of Director of Business development for many organisations operating in Australia in different fields (Construction, IT systems, Engineering consultancies, Facilities Management, Real Estate,Funds Management, Natural Resources, International Trading and Manufacturing).
Michel’s partnership with The Agency (Projects division for Sites & Acquisitions Sales), focuses on multi staged developments through to high end boutique projects, houses and land, and DA approved or raw sites. Michel’s extensive knowledge and invaluable experience are coupled with a diversified array of high calibre networks in Australasia and the MENAT region.

Professor Name: Kapil CHAUHAN
=====================================================================================================
Dr Kapil Chauhan's research examines how fluids such as water and air flow over various surfaces under different conditions. The resulting increase in understanding will lead to faster, cheaper and 'greener' transport; lower pollution in residential areas; and smaller carbon footprints for high-rise buildings.
"My research involves examining fluid flow, primarily of air and water. In particular, I investigate the boundary layer, which is a thin layer of fluid flowing adjacent to a surface.
"Almost all boundary layers in engineering applications are turbulent, meaning that the flow is characterised by random or chaotic behaviour. Turbulence is almost everywhere around us, and affects many important aspect of our lives. A better understanding of turbulence can lead us to design fuel-efficient aircraft, ships and land vehicles, better predict atmospheric flows and weather, and develop more sustainable infrastructure.
"I study various aspects of turbulence that are relevant to urban living, such as drag, dispersion and entrainment.
"Reducing the drag that occurs within the boundary layer as aircrafts and ships move through air or water can lead to significant savings in fuel costs and make transport faster and more environmentally friendly.
"Dispersion and entrainment are responsible for the transport of pollutants. Being able to predict dispersion in urban flows is important for the planning and development of residential and industrial areas.
"My research also has applications in natural ventilation, where solar energy is used to passively cool high-rise buildings, reducing the building's carbon footprint.
"The complexity of turbulent flows is what drives my passion to understand their behaviour.
"I have been studying turbulent boundary layers for more than 14 years. Since I joined the University of Sydney in early 2015, the wide array of experimental facilities and academic expertise available has expanded my area of research and encouraged me to examine new problems in natural ventilation and water quality."

Professor Name: Yuan CHEN
=====================================================================================================
Professor Yuan Chen’s research aims to translate the superior properties of carbon nanomaterials into applications that will ensure a sustainable future for humankind.
“Throughout history, the materials we have used have primarily defined our quality of life – from stone, bronze, and iron to metal alloys, silicon, and plastics.
“Over the past 20 years, carbon nanomaterials have been discovered to possess many fascinating properties that differ significantly from other materials. For example, a tiny, single-walled carbon nanotube with a diameter of less than one ten-thousandth of human hair has electrical conductivity more than 1000 times greater than that of copper, while a two-dimensional atomic-scale layer of graphene is the strongest material ever tested.
“As a chemical engineer, I want to develop scalable chemical processes to translate these properties into practical applications with minimal environmental and health risks.
“One fascinating example is the development of a new generation of electrochemical energy storage devices. Lithium-ion batteries have been used in a wide range of applications. However, the fast-growing energy storage demands require energy storage devices with higher energy and higher power density and depending on sustainable materials.
“My research aims to develop efficient, cost-effective, and reliable energy storage solutions. This will create commercial opportunities and bring significant environmental benefits in accelerating the shift to renewable energy andachieving carbon neutrality.”
“I am also working on synthesising carbon catalysts for efficient energy conversion and water treatment, creating novel carbon nanomaterial-based membranes and antibacterial materials, and controlling the structure of single-walled carbon nanotubes for a new generation of smaller and faster electronics.

Professor Name: Ken CHUNG
=====================================================================================================
If someone told you that the social connection(s) you have can mean the difference between life and death, project success and failure, or that the location of the social network you are situated in is associated with your work performance, you'd probably be surprised. But Dr Ken Chung's research into human networks - be they social or professional networks, collaboration or awareness networks - shows that network properties at the individual, relationship and network levels are extremely influential on work performance, project success, organisational commitment, coordination, learning, innovation adoption and human behaviour.
"
Network models have very real applications and implications.
"In knowledge-intensive work within projects and organisations, networks often explain why a project stops or goes ahead, how work gets done, or how information and knowledge flows or otherwise. Networks are also useful in identifying factions and informal groups, as well as those who hold brokerage roles either as knowledge champions or opinion leaders; these roles are often pivotal for advocating or resisting change. A functional manager in a department may be the leading resistance in her group towards organisational transformation your project strives to achieve. But gaining trust and nurturing the relationship with the deputy manager is sometimes more effective in steering the decision of the functional manager, who confides in her deputy, than confronting and negotiating with the functional manager directly.
"In health care, for example, when a person is diagnosed with cancer, this is generally very distressing news that evokes a strong emotional response. At the same time, they're being given a lot of information regarding available specialists and treatments. In trying to navigate the healthcare system, they can often get lost. Knowing where and who to turn to in order to access and navigate the healthcare system is hugely beneficial here. In turn, referral patterns of doctors and specialists are often a function of the structure of their professional network, which can affect the timeliness of medical intervention for good quality care.
"The networks within which we exist - and how we navigate them - can affect outcomes in a very real way, and my ultimate aim is to disseminate this idea by studying complex social networks of knowledge professionals, policymakers, project managers and so on. We are living in a connected world, where a change at one point affects the whole, with sometimes life-altering consequences.
"Just as there are laws in the natural science of physics, I am interested in the laws of social physics and social systems, guided by these theoretical questions: What forms of social network structures, at the network, actor and relational levels, are conducive to improved individual and organisational outcomes? Are there laws of social physics that govern such inherent relationships? If so, what are their assumptions, limitations and challenges?"
Ken is an Associate Professor and Associate Head of School (Undergraduate Education) at the School of Project Management. Ken has research expertise in stakeholder engagement; and social network theory and analysis for exploring outcomes such as stakeholder assessment, prioritisation, learning, motivation, performance at the individual, team, project and organisational levels. He has won several research grants at the university, national (ARC DP) and international levels. Most recently, he was awarded the Project Management Institute (PMI) grant for exploring stakeholder engagement through the use of social media in public infrastructure projects. In education, Ken cares deeply about student engagement, transformative learning and teaching that inspires. In 2021, he was awarded the Faculty of Engineering's Dean's award for excellence in outstanding teaching. He has provided consultancy services and worked closely with schools, community & industry partners, including NSW Department of Planning, Industry & Environment, Western Sydney Airport, Google, Atlassian, PwC, ANZ, Australian National Preventative Health Agency, to name a few.
Prior to Sydney, Ken held tenured lectureship at the University of Wollongong in the former School of Information Systems and Technology and his Ph.D (awarded in 2009 from the School of Information Technologies at the University of Sydney) research won the RailCorp Prize for "Addressing Society's Needs in Research Project Work" at the 2005 Research Conversaziones. His doctoral research focused on the development of a social networks based model for understanding individual performance and technology use in knowledge-intensive work. Ken also has extensive industry experience in the Information Technology and Telecommunications space. This includes his role as Systems Integrator at Protocom Technologies and the Telstra Messaging (Text & SMS) Group, where he was involved in several multi-million dollar IT projects relating to development and implementation of short-message-service (SMS) software on Telstra's Messaging Access Intelligent Network System. Prior, he led online advertisement campaign coordination for DoubleClick Australia (now acquired by Google) and PostClick.

Professor Name: PJ CULLEN
=====================================================================================================
Plasma is the fourth state of matter, with the spectacular Northern Lights being one of the best-known plasma displays on earth. But plasma technologies are also being developed for use in applications including agriculture, green energy, water purification, cancer treatment and materials processing. Our group's aim is to reduce our traditional reliance on the chemicals currently used in products such as fertilisers, disinfectants and antibiotics.
"The ability to make non-thermal plasmas using atmospheric air opens the potential for large-scale applications such as enhancing agricultural plant growth without the use of traditional fertilisers, and purifying food and water without the use of traditional chemicals such as chlorine.
"Hotter, thermal plasmas are generated using high-powered lasers that can be used in remote elemental analysis of materials. Such diagnostic lasers are best known for their use on the Mars rovers, but potential applications closer to home include the real-time detection of harmful heavy metals in food and the environment. We are currently testing this technology to detect metals such as arsenic in foods in Bangladesh.
"The ultimate goal of my research is the adoption of plasma technologies to move away from our current reliance on traditional chemicals towards more targeted and environmentally friendly solutions to a range of global social, environmental and industrial challenges including food, water and climate issues.
"I find it exciting to be building new solutions to meet current challenges. Often, developments and success in one target application open potential new ones, hence the diversity of my research areas. I find the mixture of fundamental and applied research particularly interesting: it really encourages multidisciplinary collaboration.
"I've been working in this field since the early 2000s, and I joined the University of Sydney in 2019. Being here allows me to link diverse fields of research, from plasma physics to agriculture. Access to the facilities here, such as greenhouses and farmland, is also important for the scaling up and testing of these technologies."
Professor Cullen received his bachelor's and PhD degrees from University College Dublin, Ireland. Prior to joining the University of Sydney in 2019, he was a professor at the University of Nottingham in the UK. He has also held academic positions at UNSW Sydney and the Technological University Dublin. He has published over 300 journal articles and is designated as a highly cited author by Clarivate Analytics for 2017 - 2022.

Professor Name: Daniel DIAS-DA-COSTA
=====================================================================================================
With ongoing advances in the construction industry involving the introduction of new building materials and technologies, our ability to predict the structural behaviour and safety of these innovations is critical. Associate Professor Daniel Dias-da-Costa's research into advanced computational simulation techniques aims to enhance the safety of our built environment by addressing a wide range of building materials, including concrete, masonry and glass.
"My research in structural engineering and material mechanics aims to introduce a new computational framework that will have a strong impact on practice engineering. This framework will effectively bridge high-end simulation and monitoring approaches, such that structural designers can explore the full potential of challenging construction designs.
"I develop computational techniques that can be used to simulate real-life structural failure. This allows us to efficiently predict the behaviour and response of structures in such situations; for instance, when concrete starts crushing or cracking, or when reinforcing steel yields and slips against the concrete.
"This is a very complex and computationally demanding task, and even high-end commercial software often fails to deliver reliable solutions. Therefore, I have been developing new programs to address this need. This approach has already shown good performance with a wide range of problems and materials.
"I really enjoy performing experimental tests of large-scale structures, where I have the chance of pushing the materials to the limit. In this way I can deeply understand the structural response. I then bring this knowledge to my numerical models and am able to run simulations of different situations that cannot be tested otherwise. This combined approach is crucial to achieve safer design solutions.
"I am passionate about my research because it can be applied to a wide range of different areas. This gives me the opportunity to deal with people from very different backgrounds, which in fact is what I find most enriching and rewarding about my work."
Associate Professor Daniel Dias-da-Costa received a BS in Civil Engineering from the University of Porto and an MSc and PhD in Civil Engineering, from the University of Coimbra in Portugal.
His current research interests include both numerical and experimental topics of structural engineering and material mechanics. In the first case, he addresses the development of finite element enrichment techniques and solution finding algorithms for highly non-linear problems in the simulation of fracture. The experimental research is focused on image processing techniques for structural assessment and monitoring, including the identification of strain localisation and cracking propagation.
Daniel joined the School of Civil Engineering at the University of Sydney in 2013.

Professor Name: Itai EINAV
=====================================================================================================
The more Professor Itai Einav realises he doesn't know, the happier he is. His research into granular materials and particulate systems is driven by a passion for the unknown and a determination to continue extending the boundaries of geomechanical knowledge.
"I work with everything from the micron-sized particles found in powdered substances used in drugs to beach sand to large boulders. Anywhere there are particles, I'm there!
"What makes me happy is when I find out that I don't know something. That makes me curious, and it makes my research versatile and vibrant and interesting.
"When I start out on any research path I don't confine myself to aiming for a particular application. Of course I want my research to lead to something useful - otherwise I haven't done my job. But I try not to ask too many questions in the first instance about what those applications will be. I simply focus on understanding how particles behave under various conditions, and then try to apply what I've learned for some purpose.
"For example, some of the research my colleagues at SciGEM and I have done has improved our understanding of heat transfer within granular media, and this has led to commercial applications in seemingly unrelated systems, such as the cooling of computer processors and medical units. In another example, the knowledge gained through our research in breakage mechanics - a theory I developed in 2007 - has led to applications that aim to improve the productivity of mining operations, by blasting to precondition rocks so that they flow more freely without compromising safety.
"But I didn't set out to achieve either of those applications. I'm driven simply by the desire to understand fundamental phenomena. Then, once a particular phenomenon is understood, we'll know what we can do with that knowledge.
"I think it's such a challenge just to understand things. As a human being, I can't run as fast as a cheetah, I can't swim as well as a dolphin - but I can use my brain to understand things. And this is what I want to do.
"When people say to me, 'Are you crazy? Why would you study that?', I know that's exactly what I should be studying."

Professor Name: Abbas EL-ZEIN
=====================================================================================================
Abbas is currently pursuing two research strands. The first aims to protect groundwater from contamination by developing a better understanding of the chemo-hydro-mechanical behaviour of natural material such as clay and enhance its performance as buffer against pollutants generated by industrialised nations. This research draws on the hydrology, chemistry, and mechanics of soil, using theoretical and experimental, as well as computational approaches, including deterministic, stochastic, and machine-learning techniques. The goal of the second strand of research is to develop better adaptation to sea level rise and urban and peri-urban flooding, under different scenarios of climate change. This research uses concepts of resilience and vulnerability to better understanding of the interaction between geophysical, technological, and socio-economic dimensions of environmental risk.
Professor Abbas El-Zein leads the Geoenvironmental Engineering Research Group and runs the Geoenvironmental Laboratory (GEL) at the University of Sydney. His research interests are in soil hydrology, groundwater contamination, flooding and sea level rise. His research has been funded by ARC Discovery and Linkage grants. Abbas has a BE in Civil Engineering from the American University of Beirut, Lebanon, an MS (with distinction) from the University of Southampton in the UK, an MS in Environmental Science from the ENPC in Paris, France, and a PhD in Computational Mechanics from the University of Southampton. Abbas has advised governmental, non-governmental and international organisations on problems of water resources and environmental sustainability.

Professor Name: Dagan FENG
=====================================================================================================
Professor Dagan Feng's research in the areas of biomedical and multimedia information technology seeks to address the major challenges in "big data science" and provide innovative solutions for stochastic data acquisition, compression, storage, management, modeling, fusion, visualization and communication.
Currently, Professor Feng and his research collaborators are working on new ways of improving the early detection of diseases such as cancer and dementia.
"By giving doctors a better chance of identifying disease in its early stages, we are giving patients a better chance of recovery," he said.
"A disease like dementia is a major global health problem that is increasing as the population ages. It is going to be a particular issue in China, where the one-child policy is going to produce a population with a high percentage of old people.
"Early diagnosis of dementia, when the symptoms are mild, is critical to optimise the benefits of new treatments but unfortunately, subtle brain function reductions are extremely difficult to detect, even for the most experienced experts.
"Our research will develop computer-assisted diagnosis of early dementia, when treatment is possible, by improving our ability to read and interpret the information we receive from PET-CT scans.
"We are seeking to greatly enhance the smart use of information and facilitate important new scientific discoveries", says Professor Feng.
(David) Dagan Feng received his ME in Electrical Engineering & Computing Science (EECS) from

My research interest and expertise is in developing technologies for the production of clean water, energy and othe resources at low cost and low environmental impact. This involves implementing Circular Economy principles, while exploring the economic drivers of low emission technologies such as the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) chain, membrane separation processes for water treatment, such as reverse osmosis (RO), and performing Life Cycle Assessments of various product value chains. I also aim to understand the intricacies and limitations of processes by analysing the coupled interactions between fluid dynamics, mass transport and reactions, such as the complex phenomena occuring in membrane systems that lead to concentration polarisation and fouling, in order to propose alternatives for design and operation that can yield lower energy requirements and overall costs.
Dr. Fimbres Weihs received his B.Eng. in Chemical and Systems Engineering in 2002 from Tecnológico de Monterrey, Mexico, and his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering in 2008 from the University of New South Wales (UNSW), in Sydney, Australia, at the UNESCO Membrane Science and Technology Centre. During his doctoral work he used numerical simulations of fluid dynamics (CFD) to analyse the flows within the membrane modules that are used for water treatment and desalination. He also worked on a desalination linkage project between the University of New South Wales and the European Union, as part of Framework Programme 6.

Professor Name: David FLETCHER
=====================================================================================================
As a specialist in computational fluid dynamics modelling, Adjunct Professor David Fletcher develops computer models of engineering problems involving fluid flow, heat transfer and chemical reactions for a wide range of applications. While rapid developments in technology have greatly advanced his research, he is particularly passionate about educating the next generation of skilled practitioners in this important field.
"Among the intended outcomes of my current research projects are improved understanding of fluid build-up in the spinal cord following injury, devices that will deliver drugs to the lungs more efficiently, means of reducing the requirements for repeated heart surgery in children and processing technologies that will increase the safety and efficiency of chemical and minerals plants.
"I'm excited by the rapid developments in computing power that have meant I can now tackle problems such as these in a way that even a few years ago would not have been possible. I work with the world-leading software in this area and have strong links with the developers worldwide, so I am using the most up-to-date versions at all times. It's very exciting being at the cutting edge of my field.
"I would also really like to educate more engineers in the use of computational fluid dynamics, so they can have an impact on Australian research and industry. I'm much less worried about the exact problems they will study than I am about addressing the lack of skilled computational fluid dynamics engineers in Australia. Many users of the software have no understanding of the underlying mathematics and models that it is based upon, so are not capable of using it correctly. I would really like to leave behind a large pool of well-educated computational fluid dynamics engineers.
"I've been working in this field since completing my PhD in 1982. I joined the University of Sydney in 1993, which has enabled me to collaborate with some really top researchers and to achieve some fantastic research across a wide range of areas. I'm particularly excited about the access to supercomputing facilities that open up some very stimulating projects."
David Fletcher has a BSc and PhD in mathematics from the University of Exeter UK, and an Habilitation à Diriger des Recherches in Chemical Engineering from the Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse, France. He is an Adjunct Professor at Sydney University. His expertise is in the numerical simulation of fluid flow, heat and mass transfer and coupled systems, including Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) problems. Over his career, he has published over 340 journal papers in CFD, with emphasis on combustion, multiphase flow, mixing, micro-flows, pharmaceutical inhalers and various biomedical systems.

"We are living in a time of transition from fossil-based to sustainable energy sources. I don't know what name will be given to this time in the future, but I believe it will be considered as important as the 19th century's industrial revolution.
"In energy systems, granular media are commonly used to store, convert, capture and produce energy. Examples include lithium-ion batteries, solid oxide fuel cells and thermal storage systems.
"The function of granular materials in energy systems involves essentially the transport of electrons, heat and ionic species. Controlling the performance of such systems is encumbered by complex multi-physical interactions of matter and structure across a large range of length scales.
"My research focuses on the fundamental mechanics of heterogeneous materials, including sands, powders and foams. It aims to improve our fundamental understanding of these transport phenomena, to improve the functionality of energy systems and reduce their risks of failure.
"I feel fortunate to be able to work on many types of energy systems, including nuclear fusion and various energy storage systems.
"I'm excited about finding solutions to these engineering challenges. For complex engineering problems, the solutions can often be simple and beautiful.
"I have been working in this field for more than 10 years, and joined the University of Sydney in 2010. The University provides me with the freedom to carry out varied research in a supportive environment."
Dr. Yixiang Gan received the Dr.-Ing degree (with
summa cum laude
) from the University of Karlsruhe (now Karlsruhe Institute of Technology), Germany. He received the BE/BBA and ME degrees from the Xi'an Jiaotong University, China. He joined USYD in 2010, first as a Postdoctoral fellow, then Lecturer and Senior Lecturer. His research areas include mechanics of granular and porous media, multiphase flow, mechanics of interfaces, heat and electrical conduction, and carbon geo-sequestration.
Granular materials include everything from sand and rocks to flour and salt, and can display some of the characteristics of gases, liquids and solids. They are of interest not only to children playing on the beach but to mining and pharmaceutical engineers as well as a range of other industries. Dr Yixiang Gan studies how they can affect the efficiency and reliability of our energy systems.

Professor Name: Tom GOLDFINCH
=====================================================================================================
Engineering has an enormous impact on society, and is fundamentally driven by the needs and wants of people. Despite this, it is often seen as a purely technical profession. Engineering education specialist Dr Tom Goldfinch researches the social and cultural aspects of engineering design and practice, and how they are - and might better be - reflected in engineering education.
"Engineering education needs to be grounded in the realities of engineering practice, which include social expectations and economic and environmental constraints. Universities have a responsibility to ensure that graduate engineers are appropriately prepared for a highly collaborative and complex profession where the technical challenges are often the easiest to resolve and the social and cultural ones are the hardest.
"I am passionate about engineering education that doesn't shield students from the complexities of the real world - where design parameters are constantly moving, technologies are ever evolving, project goals and priorities must be explored and understood, and stakeholders must be identified and relationships formed.
"I became interested in this field when, as a mechanical engineering undergraduate, I became frustrated that while much of my degree was engaging and real-world-focused, many units of study were presented in traditional lecture-and-textbook format, with only a distant connection to the world of engineering practice that I was already familiar with.
"I am particularly passionate about understanding the interactions between engineering and Australian Indigenous cultures. Contemporary Australian engineering methods and practices have largely evolved from European cultural influences. Only recently have other perspectives - including those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures - begun to be considered. More needs to be understood about how such alternative worldviews might contribute to the advancement of engineering.
"I've been working in the field of engineering education development and research since the mid-2000s. When I joined the University of Sydney in 2017, the opportunities for collaboration and scaling up of my research were immediately apparent. The University of Sydney is big place and highly connected. Researchers are well supported and presented with many open doors."

Computational Fluid Dynamics, Turbulent Mixing, Aerodynamics, Physics-informed Machine Learning
Michael Groom received a BSc in 2013 from the University of Tasmania majoring in applied mathematics, followed by an MPE in 2016 and a PhD in 2020, both from the University of Sydney in aerospace engineering. From 2020-2021 he was employed as a post-doctoral research associate in the Australian Centre for Field Robotics and in 2021 he commenced his current role as an Associate Lecturer in the School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering.
Michael's research interests are in computational fluid dynamics; both fundamental studies of compressible turbulence and turbulent mixing using direct numerical simulation, as well as applied studies of ship airwakes and aircraft wakes, including the operation of additional flight vehicles in those wakes. Recently he has become interested in combining predictive methods for partial differential equations, based on machine learning, with conventional, physics-based numerical methods to more efficiently provide approximate solutions to problems in external aerodynamics.

Professor Name: Joachim GUDMUNDSSON
=====================================================================================================
Associate Professor Joachim Gudmundsson's research focuses on developing effective algorithms and data structures for geometric data. In particular, he analyses movement - of people, of animals, of traffic - of anything for which we want to know more about movement patterns.
"Early analysis of movement data was done manually - and it still is, to a large extent - but the recent explosion in the amount of tracking available data requires novel analytical tools to further enhance the information that can be extracted. Algorithms can be applied to many different applications to support the work of experts in particular areas.
"For example, I am currently working with ecologists in Israel, using algorithms to detect bird migration patterns. In this way we can better understand the birds' movements, and provide tools to improve the management of endangered species.
"I've also been working with sports analysts in France. Cameras record football player's movements during games, then we analyse the data, calculate all possible passes, identify each player's movements and map out alternative options if they are available. This information can then be used to find out each player's weak and strong points, to improve training exercises and to develop set pieces.
"My research basically involves working out a step-by-step description of how to solve problems. I really liked solving puzzles when I was a kid, and in my current work I'm just trying to solve bigger and more complicated problems. It's incredibly exciting to solve a problem that no one else has been able to solve - I get a genuine buzz from it.
"I've been working in this area for 15 years. I received a Future Fellowship from the Australian research Council three years ago, which has allowed me to continue develop my research."

=====================================================================================================
Granular materials such as sand and snow have the ability to behave both as solids (in sand dunes and snowdrifts) and as fluids (in hourglasses and avalanches). Dr François Guillard studies the properties and behaviours of granular materials and of brittle porous media, which have implications for industries including construction, mining, agriculture and pharmaceuticals.
"Granular materials are present everywhere in nature and in industry, but they exhibit extremely complex and rich behaviours that we don't yet fully understand. For example, no one knows quite how sandcastles hold together, how we can walk on sand or snow, or what happens inside a box of cereal.
"My research focuses particularly on the behaviour of granular materials when they are flowing, and how they transition between this behaviour and their solid state.
"I'm also studying how brittle porous media - such as rocks and sandstone, snow, volcanic ashes and even bones - behave under load and chemical degradation. I use puffed rice grains as a model material, for example, which can be brittle when dry but become soft and mushy when they stay too long in a liquid such as milk. These principles are of tremendous importance for both natural and artificial brittle porous materials that are compacted under load and soaked in water.
"In addition, I am involved in advancing the technology used to study granular materials. Currently we cannot see the behaviour of the grains below the surface, so I am developing X-ray radiography methods to study in real time and in three dimensions how granular materials flow internally.
"A better understanding of the properties and behaviours of such materials, combined with better experimental investigation techniques, can improve the safety and efficiency of numerous industrial processes, including the construction industry's use of sand, concrete and composite materials; the mining industry's methods of ore extraction and processing; the agricultural industry's storage, transport and processing of cereal grains; and the pharmaceutical industry's bulk handling and delivery of drugs in powdered form.
"I've been working in this field since 2010, and I joined the University of Sydney in 2013. Working here has greatly broadened my research interests and afforded me more direct access to the practical implications of my research. It also provides access to state-of-the-art infrastructure and facilities, which is of tremendous help in developing and addressing my research questions."

Professor Name: Wibowo HARDJAWANA
=====================================================================================================
The emerging 5G mobile network will need to handle numerous types of traffic, including applications and devices ranging from the internet of things (IoT) to high-demand mobile broadband. These traffic types have elastic requirements with regard to bandwidth, latency and reliability, requiring network operators to regularly program their radio resources according to demand. While the radio access mobile networks of today will be interoperable with any of the above devices due to their conformance with standards, the software and interfaces used to manage radio resources remain proprietary 'black boxes' to everyone except the original equipment manufacturers. This is where Wibowo Hardjawana's research in wireless network softwarisation comes in.
"My research aims first to create mobile technology disruption by enabling proprietary software and interfaces to be software programmable by network operators - or, effectively, by anyone. This will then be followed up with development of various theoretical signal processing and radio resource allocation techniques, as well as network architectures that exploit open interfaces and networks to deal with traffic elasticity and to overcome the current limitations of wireless networks.
"Within the next three to five years my colleagues and I plan to implement our theoretical research findings as proof-of-concepts to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of fully open and configurable wireless mobile networks.
"This will be beneficial for Australian telecommunications in two ways. Firstly, it will provide telco operators with the opportunity to configure networks according to their requirements, which is currently not possible. Secondly, the open network will create a new ecosystem where start-ups can develop their own innovations.
"I have been developing novel algorithms and architectures for wireless mobile networks since 2008, and here at the University of Sydney I am very lucky to have as my mentor Professor Branka Vucetic, who is one of the best in the field."

=====================================================================================================
Dr. Harre works at the intersection of artificial intelligence, economics, and psychology. He believes that it is here that we can use AI to change society for the better by modelling collective human behaviour more accurately and making machines more useful.
"If we start by understanding how each individual makes a decision and then simulating this process, across millions of people, we can build up a clear picture of how social dynamics emerge from a diverse variety of individual behaviours. Then, by placing AI into the milieu, we can test how adaptive machines can improve our collective outcomes. In this sense it's important for us to develop better representations of how our social psychology works and how we can model it. I believe this will be one of the most important developments in AI and social simulations in the coming decades."

Dr. Michael Harre received his PhD in economic game theory from the University of Sydney in 2009, focusing on the psychology of games and the tipping points where economic systems can suddenly collapse. He went on to lead a US Airforce funded program that produced an Artificial Intelligence that could simulate the human-like psychology of how 'amateurs' and 'experts' are able to learn using artificial neural networks. Following on from this, he was the led researcher on an ARC Discovery Project that simulated psychological factors, such as herding behaviour, in buying and selling in housing markets. He currently works on using economic game theory and concepts from psychology, such as "Theory of Mind" and "Introspection", to produce more adaptive, social artificial intellligence.

Professor Name: Michael HEISEL
=====================================================================================================
In a broad sense, Dr. Michael Heisel’s research investigates complex fluid mechanics in environmental and geophysical applications. The overarching theme of his work is to improve both our understanding of the flow dynamics and how the dynamics are represented in models used by practitioners. These models can have a wide range of purposes including researching global weather and climate, predicting wind farm power performance, tracking the movement of particles and chemicals in the atmosphere, and anticipating flood conditions in river channels, to name a few.
More specifically, Michael’s research studies boundary layer turbulence and the emergence of persistent coherent patterns within the turbulence. The most prominent example of a boundary layer in his research is the planetary boundary layer that forms the lowest kilometer or so of the atmosphere above the Earth’s surface. There are also boundary layers in lakes, oceans, and rivers, where the effects of turbulence play a key role in the health of these environments and the lifeforms within them.
In some ways, the seemingly chaotic behavior of a turbulent flow adds a level of art and subjectivity to the research. Similar to an abstract painting, if you provide five scientists with turbulence measurements, there may be five perspectives and interpretations based on how they analyse the data. This art within the science makes the research both fun and challenging.
Depending on the project, Michael's research may utilize experiments in a large wind tunnel, field measurements from meteorological towers, or computational simulations. Michael has extensive experience as an experimentalist using techniques including particle image velocimetry and hotwire anemometry. He also manages a large-eddy simulation code that can be deployed to perform simulations on high-performance computing systems.
Dr. Michael Heisel joined the University of Sydney as a lecturer in 2023. His role includes teaching and research in the general areas of fluid mechanics and the environment. His research seeks to better understand the effects of turbulence on the atmosphere and in other geophysical flow applications. Prior to moving to Sydney, Michael worked and studied in the United States.
Michael received a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Rice University in 2012, where his interest in fluid mechanics was sparked by an enthusiastic and engaging undergraduate instructor. Michael then worked professionally at an engineering consulting firm for three years before deciding to pursue a higher degree. He developed a fondness for scientific research and boundary layer turbulence at the University of Minnesota, where he earned a PhD in Civil Engineering and a minor in Aerospace Engineering in 2020. Following his PhD, Michael spent three years extending his graduate research to atmospheric flow applications as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California in Los Angeles until he joined the University of Sydney.

Professor Name: Andrew HILL
=====================================================================================================
Well-designed autonomous vehicles can benefit industry by acting more consistently and reliably than human-operated vehicles, increasing efficiency and safety. Fleets of autonomous vehicles can offer further benefits by optimising their actions to reduce congestion and redundant work, lowering fossil fuel consumption and carbon emissions. All of these applications require robust planning and control algorithms, and this is the focus of Dr Andrew Hill's research.
"My work focuses particularly on using fleets of automated vehicles to perform large-scale industrial operations, such as hauling materials in mining or agriculture.
"While it's relatively easy to control a single autonomous vehicle driving on a straight road in good weather, controlling a whole fleet of autonomous vehicles that have to interact with each other in different conditions and scenarios can be much more complicated.
"Controlling a single vehicle typically means following a simple set of road rules designed for safety. Controlling a fleet requires you to optimise how these rules are followed for the fleet, deciding which vehicles should go where and in what order, constantly monitoring and re-evaluating and making predictions based on uncertain performance. It becomes even harder in the 'real world', where things rarely go to plan.
"Field robotics is the future of automation in the real world. It involves autonomous devices that operate outside the bounds of factories and production lines, instead interpreting and interacting with the world, with other machines and with people.
"While some people see the goal of robotics as 'replacing jobs with robots', that's really not the purpose. A lot of my work is about safety, such as moving people away from working in harsh desert environments or with dangerous explosives. It's also about efficiency, in that a lot of these tasks are boring and laborious, so people get distracted or cut corners and make mistakes. A person directing a robot to do these tasks still needs to make the same decisions, but the execution can be done more efficiently, safely and often with higher precision by a robotic vehicle.
"I've always been interested in making things work on their own. From Lego and Meccano to programming, I find building machines and making them do useful or interesting things a fascinating process."

Professor Name: David HILL
=====================================================================================================
"My research involves many technical challenges, as the electrical power system of the future will be enormously complex. I enjoy this work because I'm interested in complex dynamic networks - how they are modelled, analysed, controlled and planned - so a large electrical power system with its associated energy sources, storage and loads provides me with challenges in all these areas.
"I am very motivated by the idea that debates about climate change and the solutions needed can be settled by science and engineering rather than politics.
"I hope to show that a clean energy system really can provide a stable electricity supply at reasonable cost, which should then have an influence on debate and policy towards making it happen.
Current Work
The tremendous energy transition occurring world-wide and particularly in Australia has been described recently in terms of
decarbonisation, digitalisation,
distributed
(energy resources) and
democratisation
. The decarbonisation agenda in NSW has a high profile under Minister Matt Kean. This is boosted greatly by entrepreneurial leaders leading to a whole new future grid emerging in terms of energy hubs, batteries, renewable energy zones (REZs) and new more flexible transmission. Alongside this, new DERs - particularly rooftop PV - based on households and commercial buildings are being installed at a world-leading rate, i.e. the total generation capacity roughly matches that of a large coal-fired power station as plans emerge to retire these stations much earlier than originally planned.
Along with these DERs comes a new empowerment of consumers (aka customers, users, prosumers, prosumagers, people in houses etc) to serve their own power needs and sell services to the grid maybe via aggregator entities including microgrids, VPPs and new markets. This represents a new democratisation replacing the previously highly centralised structures. These changes overall will lead to a completely new electrical system that will work to provide inexpensive, reliable power with near-zero emissions. This will be enabled by digitalisation where modern data-based methods for monitoring and control can manage the new overall system.
To name just two areas of interest now: 1) there is a need to deal with new dynamics analysis and control (fast EMT in non-synchronous inverter-based dynamics replacing the time separated scales of classic RMS models); 2) the optimal granulated architecture from households (at kWs) to the national grid (at GWs). There is much research to be done with some big questions to answer. For example the latter topic asks how to better coordinate the two systems based around DERs and REZs so customers do not pay twice. These questions must be answered during an unprecedented rate of change and need to be addressed in a multi-disciplinary way with engineers, economists and social scientists. Moreover the answers cannot be found in overseas experience with our unique ‘stringy’ grid and the uncertainties from the rate of change. Thus Australia needs research in this vital area of future electrical energy supply oriented to our own needs.

Professor Name: Jun HUANG
=====================================================================================================
Chemical catalysts have a significant effect on the speed and conditions under which chemical reactions take place, and nowhere is this more important than in the chemical manufacturing industry. Professor Jun Huang's research aims to develop new catalysts and ultimately ensure a 'greener' and more sustainable industry.
"My research focuses on catalysis engineering. Catalysis is the hastening of a chemical reaction by the addition of a substance known as a catalyst.
"Without catalysts, some chemical reactions can take days and require very high pressure and temperatures. By adding an appropriate catalyst these reactions can be completed within seconds under much lower pressure and temperatures. Catalysis engineering has therefore been extremely important to the development of the modern chemical industry. More than 90 percent of all commercially produced chemicals use the catalytic process.
"Through my research I develop new catalysts that enable the efficient and 'green' processing of raw materials into useful products, such as renewable fuels. I also develop catalysts that help to treat wastewater and clean up pollutants, and capture and convert greenhouse gases.
"I have studied and worked in different countries, including China, Germany, the US, and Switzerland, before joining the University of Sydney in 2010.
"I am excited about the scientific challenges involved in the field of catalysis, because solving them has the potential to make a real contribution to society. New catalysts can be directly applied in the production of biofuels and chemicals and in the reduction of pollutants. This will offer new jobs, a cleaner environment and more sustainable products."
Professor Jun Huang was educated at the Institute of Chemical Technology at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. He received specialised training in catalysis at the South German Catalysis Institute by nine renowned professors and an emerging course of Biorefinery Technology and Renewable Raw Materials organized by DECHEMA. After obtaining his PhD degree in 2008, Dr. Huang moved to the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology, USA for his Postdoctoral research. He joined a strategic energy project of catalytic routes to fuels from biomass supported by Chevron. In 2009, he started to develop novel catalysts and processes for green chemicals and biofuels in the Institute of Chemical and Bio-Engineering at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. He was appointed Lecturer at The School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at The University of Sydney in 2010 and promoted to Senior Lecturer, Associate Professor, and Professor at USyd. Jun is the Editor-in-Chief of Materials Today Sustainability.
Jun is lead organiser for the
2018 International Symposium on Advancement and Prospect of Catalysis Science & Technology.

My research lies at the intersection of two fields, robotics and computer vision. In my research, I am focused on delivering foundation methodologies and algorithms to enable robotic systems to build real-time detailed 3D representation of the environment, a problem known as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). This problem is of key importance in enabling robotic systems to progress from the structured setups such as labs and factories to operating in real world environment. My research approach draws from recent advances in fundamental fields such as stochastic systems, information theory, high performance computing, machine learning and linear and nonlinear algebra and develops principled techniques and algorithms further integrated into robotic SLAM systems.

Professor Name: Ahmad JABBARZADEH
=====================================================================================================
Everything around us is made of atoms and molecules, whose characteristics ultimately give rise to the properties and behaviours of the materials they comprise. Associate Professor Ahmad Jabbarzadeh studies materials at this scale, leading to improvements in technologies as varied as mechanical lubricants, polymeric materials, suspension liquids, joint replacements and drug-delivery implants.
"While the behaviours of some materials are predictable by more conventional methods, others are more complex. My research involves studying such complex materials at micro and nano scales, in order to better understand their properties and behaviours in various applications.
"An example of such an application is in biomedical systems, where our understanding of a material to be implanted into the human body - such as for a joint replacement or a drug-delivery device - is crucial.
"If I were to choose a single scientific milestone in the past 100 years that has led to astonishing technological acceleration, I would say our understanding of the atomic nature of matter. This has led us to the invention of new materials, processes and applications, and will continue to do so in coming years.
"I joined the University of Sydney as a postgraduate student in the mid-1990s, and have held academic and research positions here for the past 14 years. During this time I have been fortunate to liaise with world-class researchers who have inspired me to excel and look beyond the normal routines of research, and to attain a vision that may one day change the way we tackle complex problems.
"I have also learnt to focus on the quality of our research achievements and to build foundations that will take us one step higher in what we see on the horizon - a step that will be part of a lasting foundation for the next generation of researchers for years to come in our unending quest for knowledge."
Associate Professor Ahmad Jabbarzadeh is an internationally recognized molecular rheologist (science of flow and deformation of materials) and tribologist (science of friction and lubrication) whose research mainly deals with studying the properties of complex materials by advanced computational techniques at micro and nano scales.

Professor Name: Arnold Lining JU
=====================================================================================================
Keywords:
Mechanobiology, Biomechanics, Organ-on-chip, Biofabrication, Single-molecule biophysics, Thrombosis, Inflammation, Stroke, Haematology
By linking the mechanical forces behind blood flow and their effects on hematological proteins and blood clotting cells, Dr Ju has established a new field called 'mechanobiology'. His work finds better solutions to help diagnose, treat, and control blood clotting diseases.
To investigate mechanobiology at single cellular to molecular scales, Dr Ju has invented a nano-tool called the Biomembrane Force Probe (BFP). It provides precise controls and quantitative readouts in both mechanical and chemical terms, which is particularly suited for live-cell mechanosensing studies over the traditional methods in biochemistry and cell biology that are usually population-averaged and non-realtime. He also uses use single-cell biomechanical nanotools to study the mechanism of platelets that produce thrombi in a complex hemodynamic microenvironment.
Understanding the fundamental mechanobiology is not enough. Funded by NSW Boosting Business Innovation Program partnered with AXT Pty Ltd, Evident Australia and Lumicks, Dr Ju is leading an engineering team to produce a number of microfluidic devices and microvessel-on-chip platforms that can be used by clinicians to diagnose and predict blood clot risk factors for individuals and potentially telehealth. The neurologist of the NSW Statewide Telestroke Service and Royal Prince Alfred Hospital will combine the microdevices with ultrasound, CT and MRI for better prediction and pre-screening of people at risk for blood clots.
Associate Professor Arnold Ju received his PhD in Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University, USA. In 2014, he joined the Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne as a junior postdoc; and relocated in 2015 to Sydney, to join the Heart Research Institute.In early 2020, Dr Ju joined the University of Sydney (USYD)’s new BME school as a senior lecturer and started up the Mechanobiology and Biomechanics Laboratory (MBL).
A/Prof Ju currently holds an Heart Foundation Future Leader Fellowship, working at the interface between mechanical engineering and mechanobiology. His team has pioneered multiple biomechanical nanotools, including blood clot-on-chip microfluidic devices (
Nature Materials
2019), single-cell biomembrane force probes (
Nature Communications
2018), and 4-D haemodynamic modelling (
Nature
2021). Recently, he was awarded the prestigious mid-career Snow Fellowship.
His vision is to build novel platforms that integrate advanced biomanufacturing, high-throughput biomechanical manipulation, and artificial intelligence for biobank data processing. His track record spans developing, characterising, and evaluating innovations of 3D organoids and organ-on-chips, mechanobiology, imaging probes and biosensors, bio-nanotechnology, and image-based deep learning. These large facilities should provide significant benefits to interdisciplinary research in biofabrication, biomechanics and point-of-care microtechnologies.

Professor Name: Omid KAVEHEI
=====================================================================================================
While the human brain remains unparalleled in its ability to perform highly sophisticated information processing on extremely limited energy resources, Dr Omid Kavehei's research in the field of nanoelectronics aims to lead to the development of a new breed of tiny intelligent devices to collectively emulate this capability in hardware more closely than ever. Such devices are expected to be able to solve a wide range of issues involving sensory perception.
"A healthy human brain delivers an impressive information processing capability on very limited energy resources. Unlike modern artificial intelligence (AI) models, the brain does not require excessively high amounts of data to achieve an optimum learning point. It can learn 'on the fly' from experience, memory and multisensory data streams, using input from our auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory and tactile senses.
"Despite massive improvement in today's AI models and their successful practicality, they are still far from being truly intelligent or closely brain-inspired. They require excessively large training datasets and a form of supervised approach, and they consume a lot of energy.
"I believe low-power nanoelectronic devices that mimic operation of biological neurons and synapses could lead to truly intelligent brain-inspired systems that could learn from experience.
"Tiny intelligent devices that can run on batteries could revolutionise several industries, from medical devices to the internet of things. For instance, one potential application is epileptic seizures forecasting. Most people who are diagnosed with refractory epilepsy are not responsive to medication. Other than surgery, a possible step forward to improve these people's lives could be the development of an intelligent system that forecasts seizures using brain signals. Such a system must be ultra-low-power, run on batteries and learn from patients' neural activity over time to be truly effective. The system could either warn the patient about the possibility of an upcoming seizure or, as part of a responsive implant, activate neural stimulation to avoid seizures.
Omid Kavehei is a Associate Professor at the Faculty of Engineering at The University of Sydney. Prior to this role, he was with the Centre for Neural Engineering at The University of Melbourne as a Research Fellow in Microelectronics, where he worked on an Australian engineering flagship project, the Bionic Eye. During his post-doctoral time, he was a Visiting Project Scientist at the University of California at Santa Barbara.He received his PhD in Electronics from the University of Adelaide in 2012 with the Postgraduate University Alumni Medal, a University Doctoral Research Medal and the 2011 South Australian Young Nanotechnology Ambassador award.

Professor Name: Judy KAY
=====================================================================================================
Along with the allure of 'smart' technology, there is often the frustration of such devices seeming to 'have a mind of their own'. But this may one day be a thing of the past, if Professor Judy Kay has her way. Her research into human-computer interaction aims to give users systems that give people control of the systems that they use the data that those systems keep.
"I believe that we need to design and create personalised computer systems so that the user can understand and control what is happening. Many of the systems we use every day collect data about us and use that to personalise what they do. For example, if your computer personalises something for you in a certain way, you should be able to work out why it did that. If you want it to work differently, you should be able to work out how to do that. Then you can get personalisation to work for you, the way you want it to."
"The area I really want to apply this to is in helping people to learn more effectively throughout their lives. This includes learning important things like computer science! But is also covers learning to be healhier. These projects range from helping people eat more healthily, get healthy levels of exercise and maintain social connections."
"I studied at the University of Sydney, and then chose to become an academic here because I was inspired by working with our wonderful students and the intellectually rich and stimulating multidisciplinary environment."
Judy Kay is Professor of Computer Science. She leads the Human Centred Technology Research Cluster, in the Faculty of Engineering and IT at the University of Sydney. A core focus of her research has been to create infrastructures and interfaces for personalisation, especially to support people in lifelong, life-wide learning. This ranges from formal education settings to supporting people in using their long-term ubicomp data to support self-monitoring, reflection and planning. Central to this has been in the design of the Personis user modelling systems and interfaces that enable people to control their own long-term personal information from diverse sensors on devices be they worn, carried, embedded in the environment or conventional desktops.
She has integrated this into new forms of interaction including virtual reality, surface computing, wearables and ambient displays. Her research has been commercialised and deployed and she has extensive publications in leading venues for research in user modelling, AIED, human computer interaction and ubicomp.
She has had leadership roles in top conferences in these areas and is Editor-in-Chief of the IJAIED, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education (IJAIED) and Editor of IMWUT, Interactive Mobile Wearable and Ubiquitous Technology (IMWUT).

Professor Name: Mani KHEZRI
=====================================================================================================
Cold-formed steel structures are used extensively in the building industry. They are light, relatively easy and cheap to assemble and maintain, and fully recyclable, making them ideal for developing lightweight, cost-effective, environmentally responsible structures. Dr Mani Khezri's research aims to expand their use even further by enabling them to safely and reliably be combined into strong and flexible built-up sections for use in mid-rise structures.
"There is increasing interest within industry in extending the application of cold-formed steel to mid-rise structures by connecting several single sections to create built-up sections that offer higher axial and bending capacities. However, the current standards offer virtually no guidance for the design of these built-up sections.
"The research I am currently engaged with will provide a deep and comprehensive understanding of the behaviour of these built-up sections - including buckling and post-buckling behaviours - and will facilitate their optimal structural design. The main outcome will be more affordable structures that can be built faster and even in pre-fabricated forms.
"Buckling - and its consequent instabilities - has traditionally been considered the first route towards failure in structures. However, we are now able to analyse and predict this behaviour with a great degree of accuracy.
"But a new and opposite trend in this field is to use buckling as a favourable function and create scalable, reversible and robust applications that use these behaviours to advantage, such as in smart buildings and other innovative technologies.
"I am mesmerised by buckling and its complex nature. The fact that significant and somewhat unpredictable deformations can occur with just a small additional load is just one of the reasons for my interest in this field. The diversity of potential applications also fuels my interest.
"I joined the University of Sydney in 2014 as a postdoctoral research fellow. Being an academic here has created great opportunities for me, and the journey has been an incredible experience. I have enjoyed working with world-famous scholars such as Professor Kim Rasmussen, whom I have been fortunate to have as my mentor and guide."
Dr Mani Khezri started with the University of Sydney in 2014. He focuses on the development of innovative numerical methods, buckling and post-buckling behaviour of plates and of laminated plate assemblies, mathematical theory and numerical applications of Meshfree methods, fracture mechanics, and computational solid mechanics.

=====================================================================================================
Data is everywhere these days, and more is being produced at an exponential rate. Much of this so-called "big data" can be considered junk until it is analysed by sophisticated computational algorithms to reveal its compelling story. This is the focus of Dr Matloob Khushi's research.
"Big data comes in all shapes and sizes, including videos, images, financial data, medical and genomic data. My research looks at developing novel methods of analysing and managing it to unveil patterns that were not visible by applying previously known methods.
"The applications are endless, including in health, agriculture, banking, education and robotics. It's very exciting to me that the effective analysis of these ubiquitous large datasets holds the potential to improve people's lives.
"For example, by analysing and learning from big data, we can design a health-assisting gadget that can alert someone when they need to see a doctor, or an artificial intelligence-based financial agent that can advise people on where and how to invest.
"Many research laboratories already study their own internally produced datasets, but my research focuses on the integrated analysis of publicly available large datasets from cross-laboratory sources, which can potentially reveal some very interesting patterns.
"For example, my research in this area has unveiled previously unknown molecular interactions between oestrogen and progesterone receptors in regulating breast cancer, interactions that were later experimentally confirmed by another lab.
"One of my future aims is to develop novel efficient machine learning methods to analyse and manage large datasets of any nature.
"I joined the University of Sydney as a data scientist in 2008 while also completing my PhD here. After a post-doctoral fellowship and a lot of further research, I joined the School of Computer Science in 2017.
"The University of Sydney is home to many world-leading researchers, and I consider myself fortunate to be surrounded and inspired by such people. I hope to contribute further towards the University's world-leading position in research."
Dr. Khushi received his Ph.D. from the University of Sydney. His thesis title was development of novel software tools and methods for investigating the significance of overlapping transcription factor genomic interactions. He has authored over 50 research papers, his

Professor Name: Michael KIRKPATRICK
=====================================================================================================
Associate Professor Michael Kirkpatrick's research focuses on developing new and more accurate mathematical river-simulation models to predict the effects of weather, climate and flow-rate changes on water quality, enabling better management of Australia's rivers and estuaries.
"My current research focuses on the effects of thermal stratification in rivers. This occurs mostly as a result of heating by the sun, which causes the water near the surface of the river to become warmer than the water deeper down. The warm surface water is lighter than the cooler water below, so it floats on top like a hot-air balloon floats in the sky. This prevents the mixing of water that is essential for the river to remain healthy.
"A lack of mixing prevents oxygen from being carried to the deep waters, and prevents contaminants in the deep waters from escaping, making it acidic and toxic. If this situation lasts for more than a couple of days we end up with serious environmental problems, such as algal blooms, mass fish deaths and damage to the river's ecosystems.
"There are a number of natural physical processes that break down this stratification and allow a river to mix properly, and the basic idea behind my research is to develop models that can predict how effectively these processes will be operating over the coming week or so, given the current weather and flow conditions. If the model predicts a level of mixing that may lead to environmental problems, then river management authorities can increase the flow rate by releasing water into the river from upstream storage reservoirs, to prevent this from occurring.
"My aim is to develop a new generation of river-management tools that will enable us to optimise water allocation, balance the needs of all water users, and maximise both economic and environmental benefits."
Below are some videos from simulations completed for this project. Details are in the description on Youtube. These simulations were completed with my computational fluid dynamics code PUFFIN.

Professor Name: Kenny KWOK
=====================================================================================================
When wind encounters obstacles – whether natural such as forests or human-made such as buildings – wake and vortices are generated, with the disturbed wind characterised by highly turbulent flow and with rapidly changing magnitude and direction. This phenomenon can have serious safety and health implications, as it can result in building and infrastructure damage, widespread dispersal of airborne diseases and pollutants and other issues. Professor Kenny Kwok’s research seeks to better understand the interactions between wind and obstacles, in order to mitigate such adverse effects.
“Turbulent winds can have profound effects on us and our environment. The current outbreak of COVID-19 is a timely reminder of the dangers posed by the spread of airborne contaminants. Previous research of mine has investigated the role of wind behaviour in the spread of disease among high-rise buildings in a densely populated residential housing estate in Hong Kong during the worldwide outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002–2003 – the results of which are also applicable to other airborne pathogens.
“The 2009 Black Saturday bushfires generated bushfire-enhanced winds that caused significant damage to homes and infrastructure, as well as to forests. Some of my current research focuses on the interactions of these types of winds with buildings and other obstacles, with a view to building this understanding into future design and planning.
“Another phenomenon I am currently investigating is exactly how prolonged exposure to low-frequency, low-acceleration, wind-induced motion in high-rise buildings can cause motion sickness–like symptoms in some occupants, adversely affecting their wellbeing and work performance. To this end I have designed and developed unique simulators to research these neurophysiological and psychological responses, with the ultimate goal of mitigating their adverse effects.
“These are just some of the interactions between turbulent winds and the obstacles in their environment that I explore in my research.”
Since obtaining his PhD in wind engineering in 1978 from Monash University, Professor Kenny Kwok has made significant and sustained contributions to research and professional practice in wind engineering, structural dynamics, vibration control, human perception of motion, and environmental fluid mechanics, particularly with respect to the dynamic behaviour of tall buildings and flexible structures in strong winds. Professor Kwok’s research focuses on fundamental aspects of building aerodynamics and wind-structure-occupant-damper interactions, and their practical applications to real life situations. Professor Kwok rejoined the University of Sydney in 2017.

Professor Name: Timothy LANGRISH
=====================================================================================================
Professor Tim Langrish's research activities span a wide range of areas, but share a common goal of improving our quality of life. The means by which he is working to achieve this include reducing the recurrence of cancer, improving nutrition and lowering energy consumption in industry.
"I work in a range of areas including food process engineering, drying technology, energy and energy quality, solar kilns, timber drying and spray-drying technologies.
"One aspect of my research aims to assist in reducing cancer recurrence by improving the quality of foods, including adding extracts from citrus fruits to cereals. Our treatment of acute cancer issues is increasingly effective but cancer recurrence remains a significant concern, which this project is working to address.
"I am also working on new crystallisation and drying technologies that will enable us to create powdered fruit juices and milks with improved storage stability. This will allow these products to be made available in areas without access to refrigerated transport, improving the health of people in those areas, and is also a very important development in the Australian manufacturing industry.
"Other projects involve making salt that tastes saltier than normal salt, so that people can reduce their salt intake while retaining the same perception of saltiness; assisting Australian manufacturers of solar kilns to maintain their world lead in solar kiln design; and reducing energy use in industry, decreasing costs and enabling industries to maintain their competitive edge.
"The common objective of all of my work is to improve quality of life.
"I've been working in this field for the past 25 years. A strong and broadly based academic institution like the University of Sydney is essential to maintaining steady progress in this kind of work, whose complexity requires multidisciplinary and multi-faceted approaches to be taken. The University of Sydney is the best environment for providing this support."
Professor Langrish is a world leader in drying technology, particularly spray drying and the drying of timber. His work, with
Professor Fletcher
, on transient flows in spray dryers, has uncovered new types of flow instabilities that are fundamental to improving practical outcomes in reducing the deposition of particles on spray dryer walls. This achievement is scientifically significant because it applies advanced computational modelling and physical understanding to the solution of important and common industrial process engineering problems.
His recent work to develop crystallization in drying has the potential to improve the use of resources by combining crystallization and drying, which traditionally are done separately, into one operation. The industrial significance and application of this work can be judged from the improvements in productivity and quality that have been achieved for local dairy and timber industries.
Professor Langrish served as Head of School from 2008 until 2015.

Professor Name: Philip Heng Wai LEONG
=====================================================================================================
As Director of the Computer Engineering Laboratory, Professor Philip Leong's research focuses on developing novel hardware and software solutions to problems that range from derivative pricing and hedging of foreign exchange risk to the treatment of cardiac disorders.
"As an engineer, I love to create new things. Much of my work involves developing solutions to problems constrained by processing speed or power consumption. I often use field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs - a type of computer circuit that can be customised after manufacture) as my 'canvas', as they enable the development of problem-specific architectures that are orders of magnitude more efficient than microprocessor-based solutions.
"Among the applications I've pioneered have been FPGA-based financial derivative pricing systems. A number of banks have since developed their own implementations based on these systems, and have found that they offer much lower power consumption than competing technologies.
"Another of my projects focused on developing parallel software for forecasting rainfall distribution. In Hong Kong, during a heavy rain or typhoon warning, all schools and businesses are closed for safety reasons. The forecasting software my team and I developed has made more accurate rain predictions possible, and now supports the issuance of heavy rain warnings in Hong Kong.
"A current project involves at-home monitoring of people with Parkinson's disease and developing mathematical models of their gait. The aim of this work is to enhance our understanding of Parkinson's disease and improve the quality of life of people living with this condition.
"The overall goal of my research is to benefit society through improved high-performance custom hardware and parallel software.
"I've been working in this field since 1993 when I completed my PhD at the University of Sydney, where I also earlier gained a Bachelor of Science and a Bachelor of Engineering. The University has always been central to my academic career, and has favourably influenced all aspects of my research."
Philip Leong received the B.Sc., B.E. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Sydney. In 1993 he was a consultant to ST Microelectronics in Milan, Italy working on advanced flash memory-based integrated circuit design. From 1997-2009 he was with the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He is currently Professor of Computer Systems in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Sydney, Visiting Professor at Imperial College and the Chief Technology Advisor to Cluster Technology.
He was the co-founder and program co-chair of the International Conference on Field Programmable Technology (FPT); program co-chair of the International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL) and is the Senior Associate Editor for the ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems. The author of more than 150 technical papers and 4 patents, Dr. Leong was the recipient of the 2005 FPT conference Best Paper as well as the 2007 and 2008 FPL conference Stamatis Vassiliadis Outstanding Paper awards.

Professor Name: Fengwang LI
=====================================================================================================
Dr Li's research interests lie in:
electroactive materials
carbon dioxide capture and utilisation
green hydrogen and ammonia
green chemical synthesis
Our historical reliance on fossil fuels has resulted in high greenhouse gas emissions – primarily carbon dioxide – leading to climate change and a range of associated issues. Carbon capture and sequestration has therefore attracted intense interest in recent years, as a means of removing this excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However, carbon dioxide currently has low economic value, so in order for this process to become economically viable, new techniques are required to add value to the captured carbon. This is what Dr Fengwang Li’s research focuses on.
“My work uses electricity from renewable sources such as solar, wind and hydro to transform waste carbon dioxide, together with water, into economically valuable chemicals and fuels that can replace fossil fuels.
“One example is ethylene, used to produce plastics for applications from medical devices to synthetic fabrics and the basis of a US$200B global industry. Another is ethanol, a clean alternative engine fuel and fuel additive. Substituting these renewable chemicals and fuels for their current fossil-fuel–based equivalents would lead to a net reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.
“The conversion of carbon dioxide using electrons – known as carbon dioxide electrolysis – is extremely complicated. I’m working to develop novel catalyst materials that facilitate the conversion with high activity and high selectivity towards the specific product we want.
“To speed up the materials discovery and look deeper into the mechanism behind the conversion reaction, I use and develop a suite of operando/
in-situ
characterisation techniques, such as vibrational spectroscopy, microscopy and synchrotron X-ray, to capture – under operating conditions – the dynamic environment at the material surface with high spatial and temporal resolution.
“The ultimate goal is to make renewable, carbon dioxide–derived chemicals and fuels more economically compelling than fossil fuels.
“I have been working in this field since 2014, and I joined the University of Sydney in 2020. Working here offers me an exciting multidisciplinary research environment where I’m able to collaborate with experts with diverse backgrounds, both fundamental and applied. This gives me great opportunities to think widely and wildly, and to explore with full freedom.”
Dr Fengwang Li is a Senior Lecturer with the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Sydney, where he joined in April 2020. His research aims for a “greener”, carbon-neutral future relying on electrochemical energy.
Dr Li completed his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in chemistry at Renmin University of China. He gained his PhD in Chemistry in 2017 from Monash University where his doctoral thesis, on the use of atomically thin materials for electrochemical carbon dioxide catalysis, was awarded the university’s Mollie Holman Medal for best PhD thesis. He then moved to Canada to complete postdoctoral research at the University of Toronto, where he focused on developing catalysts and systems for the conversion of carbon dioxide to value-added fuels and chemicals.

Professor Name: Tongliang LIU
=====================================================================================================
In our daily lives, we make many decisions. Some are simple, but some are not. Why not let machines help? This is the principle underlying Dr Tongliang Liu's research into machine learning. He designs effective, efficient, and understandable learning algorithms - the processes machines use to "think" through datasets in order to "decide" how to respond to a problem.
"Machine learning is similar to human learning. As humans, when we encounter a problem, we think through our store of learned experience and knowledge to identify a rule that we think will apply to this situation, and we base our decision on that.
"Similarly, in machine learning, a machine presented with a problem will run algorithms ('think') through data ('experience and knowledge') to identify an applicable hypothesis ('rule'), and base its response ('decision') on that.
"My research aims to provide mathematical justifications for existing learning algorithms, and to design more effective and efficient learning algorithms for real-world problems in data mining and computer vision.
"For example, as we humans get older and gain more experience and knowledge, the decisions we make become more reliable. A similar phenomenon applies to machine learning as the amount of data collected increases. My research focuses on understanding this process, and how we can exploit it to make machine-made decisions more reliable.
"The ultimate goal would be to make machines as clever as humans. If we can develop machines that have even some of the decision-making capabilities of humans, this could reduce human labour and inconvenience and improve our quality of life. This is what motivates me to do research in machine learning.
"What excites me about this field is that recently some machine-learning algorithms have outperformed humans in several difficult problems, such as face recognition and playing the board game Go.
"I have been working in this field since 2012, and joined the University of Sydney in early 2017. The outstanding research staff and students here inspire me enormously. I believe that together we can achieve great things."

Professor Name: David LOWE
=====================================================================================================
Being able to carry out laboratory experiments is central to any science student's education, but it can be very costly for every school and university to provide access to its own suite of well-equipped science labs. The work of Professor David Lowe, a world-leading researcher into the design and use of remote laboratories, offers an innovative solution whereby many schools can share access to a small number of remote laboratories, providing students with highly engaging science experiences well beyond those that could feasibly be offered by any single school.
"Historically, in order to control or use any physical system, we all had to be located in the same place as that system. But high-speed networks are increasingly allowing us to monitor and access systems without being physically near them. My research involves exploring these interactions, and finding ways to best take advantage of the opportunities created.
"A good example is the use of laboratories in education. Rather than having science equipment in each school, which is used only for short periods by science classes and otherwise sits idle for most of the year, remote access allows this equipment to be used across many schools.
"It also means that the equipment becomes accessible 24/7, allowing students the flexibility to carry out experiments in their own time as well as repeating experiments for better understanding and outcomes.
"Possibly most significantly, remote laboratories provide opportunities for access to truly innovative experimental environments.
"I have been working in engineering research and education for around 20 years, and researching remote laboratories for the past 10. I believe that remote laboratories have the potential to lead to significantly improved science and engineering education, enhanced accessibility and flexibility, and students who are better engaged in their learning."
Professor David Lowe is currently Professor of Software Engineering in the Faculty of Engineering at The University of Sydney. Prior to this, from 2012 to 2019, he was theAssociate Dean (Education) and Deputy Dean of the Faculty. Before joining the University of Sydney in 2012 he was a Director of the Centre for Real-Time Information Networks (CRIN) - a designated research strength at the University of Technology, Sydney focused on blending embedded systems and telecommunications in addressing real-world problems. From 2002-2008 he was the Associate Dean (Teaching & Learning) for the Faculty of Engineering, UTS.
He is a Principal Fellow of the Higher Education Academy. He is also the chair of the Board for the Grok Academy, a not-for-profit focused on Digital Technologies education. He was also previously the CEO of the not-for-profit organisation The LabShare Institute, and President of the Global Online Laboratory Consortium. Professor Lowe has published widely during his more than 20 year teaching career, including three textbooks and over 200 refereed publications.

Professor Name: Yiu-Wing MAI
=====================================================================================================
Professor Yiu-Wing Mai is distinguished for seminal work on fracture mechanics and materials science of advanced engineering materials. He joined the University of Sydney in 1976. Through his many publications in the past four decades, Mai has made outstanding and lasting contributions to scientific and engineering knowledge in several research areas, including:
a unified crack-wake bridging model for strengthening and toughening of coarse-grained ceramics, cementitious materials and stitched/z-pinned composite laminates, which revolutionises the microstructure design of these materials;
new fracture mechanics models for evaluation of fibre/matrix interface properties from single fibre pull-out, push-in and fragmentation tests leading to the design of high toughness composites; (c) a theoretical framework for the essential work of fracture method to measure toughness of ductile materials, especially polymer thin films and papers/newsprints;
development of superhard (>40 GPa) nanocomposites coatings on forming tools for green manufacturing through control of deposition processing parameters, microstructures and residual stresses; and
nonlinear fracture mechanics of electromagnetic materials involving the development of theoretical models and their applications to fracture characterization in the presence of magneto-electro-thermo-mechanical coupling and dissipative effects.

Professor Name: Assaad MASRI
=====================================================================================================
The burning of fuels to produce useable energy is a very old process but one that is not yet perfectly efficient, as it also produces waste and pollutants. Professor Assaad Masri leads a team of researchers who are working to devise methods leading to 'clean' combustion - both of fossil fuels and of renewable fuels such as biofuels and biodiesels - thus improving energy-conversion efficiency and reducing the emission of pollutants from engines, industrial furnaces and other combustion devices.
"When we introduce new fuel alternatives into the market, we need to ensure that these fuels can be burnt efficiently, safely and cleanly, in that they do not produce harmful emissions such as nano-sized particles that will have negative long-term health effects.
"My colleagues and I design burners that allow us to better understand turbulent combustion and hence devise tools that assist engineers to achieve this.
"Numerous burners that we have designed are now used by both industry and academia as international benchmarks for developing and validating advanced predictive methods for combustion.
"Our research uses the latest numerical tools in conjunction with state-of-the-art experimental laser-based techniques to probe flows. We work with laboratory flame as well as engines, and are also researching methods of developing micro-combustors that can be used for micro-power generation.
"Our aim is to transform combustion science in order to facilitate the optimisation of combustors by design engineers."
Assaad Masri is currently an ARC-Australian Professorial Fellow in the School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering, Faculty of Engineering at the University of Sydney and Chairman of the Australia and New Zealand section of the
Combustion Institute
. He is internationally known as a leading scientist in turbulent combustion of gaseous and liquid fuels and laser diagnostics in combustion. He is on the editorial board of three prestigious journals and a founding member of the
International Workshops on Measurements and Computations of Turbulent Nonpremixed Flames (TNF)
as well as the
International Workshop on Turbulent Combustion of Sprays (TCS)
. He has published over 150 papers, attracted over eight million dollars of research funding and established one of the most advanced combustion laser diagnostics systems in the world.

Professor Alistair McEwan's research into the electrical properties of biological tissue will enable us to better address a range of major health challenges relating to cardiovascular disease, cancer and nutrition.
"My research aims to lead to the development of new devices to improve diagnosis and treatment of health problems.
"Understanding the influence of the electrical properties of the body can enable us to learn more about neural and cell signalling, leading to better design of electronic implants and ultimately a better understanding of how the brain works.
"I am passionate about this area of research, as I believe it can lead to new diagnosis techniques, particularly in the area of low-cost devices for home health care, which will help to alleviate the incredible economic strain of the current healthcare system.
"I have had several enquiries from family members of stroke sufferers about the availability of a portable device for stroke. Clinicians in cardiology, neurology, cancer, respiration and newborn care have also indicated that they would find the devices we are working on very useful in a range of clinical and public health scenarios. As well as this, there has been interest from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in our device for measuring newborn malnutrition in developing countries. All of this interest indicates that there is a real clinical need for the kind of devices we are working to develop.
"I have been working in this field for eight years, the past three of which have been at the University of Sydney. The faculty's interest in biomedical engineering, along with the size, expertise and interest of the Sydney Medical School, has enabled me to identify and pursue research projects of real clinical need."
“Alistair McEwan works on Gadigal country and is passionate about growing and strengthening capacity in cerebral palsy and neurodevelopmental disability research. Alistair is a non-Indigenous researcher committed to supporting Indigenous-led projects and partnering with people with lived experience in all our research.
Alistair welcomes enquiries from prospective research students and encourages applications from Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander students and those with lived experience of disability.”

Professor Name: Alejandro MONTOYA
=====================================================================================================
Dr Alejandro Montoya’s research into reactive materials aims to bridge the gap between material properties at atomic scale and their useful large-scale applications in processes related to energy and chemical industrial sustainability. His unique research program in chemical engineering combines experimental (in small- and large-scale reactors) with simulation-based techniques.
“My research concentrates on biomass liquefaction, CO2 carbonation, surface processes and catalysis, combustion and atmospheric environments.
“I concentrate on developing predictive methods that can be used to optimise already established industrial processes and formulate new conditions for innovative applications.
“For example, my research into the hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass looks at developing reactive models to optimise the transformation of low-value materials into high-value products. My recent efforts have concentrated on the use of algae, breaking down its components (such as proteins, lipids and carbohydrates) to produce products that can be used as biofuels for powering engines, and at the same time potentially producing valuable pharmaceuticals.
“My work on CO2 carbonation is concerned with the heat pre-treatment of serpentine minerals to accelerate the leaching of cations for precipitation with CO2 to form carbonates, which are environmentally friendly solids that are able to retain CO2 permanently. I am working on predictive techniques to reduce the intensity of heat required to treat the rock, activate it, extract ions from it and induce the reactivity of these ions with the carbon dioxide.
“These predictive models based on first principles will then be able to be extended to any material to determine structural, electronic and reactivity properties.
“I’m passionate about my research because it’s an area that’s starting to make a real difference to the way chemical processes are optimised in industry.
“The University of Sydney has offered me excellent opportunities to develop my career, initially through a Sesqui Postdoctoral Fellowship, and now as an academic in the School of Chemical Engineering.”
Dr. Montoya completed his Ph.D in Chemical Sciences in 2002 at the Universidad de Antioquia -Colombia. He received the prestigious Sesqui Postdoctoral Fellowship from the University of Sydney (2004 -2007). He joined the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Sydney as a lecturer in 2007 and was promoted to Senior Lecturer in 2010. Dr. Montoya has been a visiting scholar at Tsinghua University (INNET), and the University of Utah (Department of Chemistry and the Department of Chemistry and Fuel Engineering).

Professor Name: Emily MOYLAN
=====================================================================================================
Transport touches all of our lives, and we often have strong opinions about it based on our experiences - whether of frustration with traffic jams or crowded buses or of satisfaction with reliable train timetables. Dr Emily Moylan has shifted her research focus from astronomy to transport, bringing with it a love of big-data analysis and a desire to apply it to complex problems that matter to real people.
"Understanding the reliability and the variability of any system is essential to properly assessing, and then improving, its performance.
"I'm interested in the ways in which we can measure, model and value the variability that exists throughout our transport system - including variability in travel time, crowding, and commuter behaviour. In order to do this I create tools that turn large datasets into information about the overall performance of the transport system. My aim is to contribute to a future transport system that is more efficient, more responsive to emerging technologies, and more resilient to climate change.
"My work involves exploring and analysing big data sets from all sorts of sources, including transit smartcards, mobile phones and fixed road infrastructure as well as online surveys or face-to-face interviews.
"This work forms a foundation for improving future decisions about, for example, whether and where to build additional infrastructure such as turning lanes, bus lanes or clearways.
"Importantly, decisions such as these ought to be based not just on increased volumes or speeds of traffic, but also on the changes in reliability experienced by travellers. My research is a step towards that goal.
"I've done research using data sets specific to cars, or specific to public transport, but a truly integrated transport system needs multimodal metrics for measuring overall performance. Methods of fusing these data sources is a key area for my research.
"I discovered my love of data during my PhD in observational astronomy. I was drawn to transport because I could use my analytical skills while working on complex, multidisciplinary problems that directly affect all of us."

Professor Name: Young NO
=====================================================================================================
Dr Young Jung No's research focuses on the development of special synthetic materials that can be implanted inside the body in order to replace, repair or regenerate body tissues that have been damaged or diseased. Known as "biomaterials", these materials could potentially offer an ultimately more successful alternative to traditional grafting techniques.
"Traditionally, when a person requires replacement bone or other tissue due to damage by disease, accident or trauma, surgeons will graft 'spare' tissue either from that person themselves or from another person. But neither option is ideal, because both rely on additional surgical and other procedures, availability of suitable donor tissue and subsequent processing of this tissue.
"Synthetic biomaterials aim to provide an off-the-shelf, customisable alternative. They should have the correct combination of physical, chemical and biological properties to restore the structure and function of the damaged tissue, and consequently restore and enhance the person's quality of life. In order to achieve this we need to understand how the body's natural cells will interact with the material, how the material will behave under loading, whether the material will leach out anything toxic inside the body, and whether the body's natural cells are able to ultimately break down the material and replace it with real tissue.
"Biomaterials is an exciting field of research. There are still a lot of scientific questions to be answered, as well as an endless combination of engineered materials yet to be explored for biomedical purposes. We can use specifically engineered metals, ceramics, plastics, gels or even a combination of these to achieve our desired properties.
"My particular focus is on developing biomaterials for musculoskeletal tissues, including bone, muscle, tendons and ligaments, all of which have significant roles in the locomotion and physical functioning of the human body.
"My goals is for the synthetic biomaterials that I develop to be used widely in clinics and hospitals around the world to help treat people with musculoskeletal diseases and conditions, and ultimately remove the reliance on grafts of human tissue as a treatment method.
"I've been working in this field since 2012, when I joined the University of Sydney to work on novel bioactive ceramics. The University has the one of the best collections of relevant facilities and, more importantly, some of the brightest minds in Australia to work with. It's also capable of attracting international collaborations for the progression of research projects into the international stage."

Professor Name: Aaron OPDYKE
=====================================================================================================
More than 114 million people were forcibly displaced from their homes in 2023 due to disasters and conflict. Dr Aaron Opdyke's research seeks to support governments, organisations, and communities respond to these escalating challenges.
“My research looks at how we can deliver more effective and inclusive solutions in humanitarian response, disaster risk reduction, and climate change adaptation. Across these settings, I am interested in understanding how communities connect with their infrastructure.”
"One stream of my work narrows on sheltering, housing, and settlements – exploring the pathways which enable communities to build safer and why they make these choices. My work in this area is actively collaborating with humanitarian partners to understand how to support communities recover after shocks."
"A second thread of my research seeks to characterise disaster risk across social and engineering boundaries. This includes developing new methods and tools to assess disaster risk which integrate scientific, local, and indigenous knowledge. I’m leading the development of more localised multi-hazard risk assessments under climate futures and developing tools to mobilise this knowledge."
"A third stream of my work looks at the systems shaping displacement from disasters and climate change. This includes exploring the processes that lead to risk creation and how organisations can respond to increasing complexity."
"I'm passionate about engineering research with communities because it's easy to relate to the impact it has on people's lives. More than ever, we're seeing development and technologies affording new opportunities to people around the world, but these advances are not happening equally. Millions of people globally still lack access to clean water, safe shelter, reliable power and other basic services. Engineers have long played a role in raising the standard of living for communities; my research seeks to ensure that this development is equitable.”
Dr Aaron Opdyke is currently a Senior Lecturer in Humanitarian Engineering in the School of Civil Engineering at the University of Sydney. His research focuses on the interface of infrastructure and social systems, examining this nexus in humanitarian response, disaster risk reduction, and climate change adaptation. He holds a PhD (2017) and Master of Science (2015) in Civil Engineering from the University of Colorado Boulder and a Bachelor of Science Honors (2013) in Civil Engineering from California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obsipo.

Professor Name: Julien POLLACK
=====================================================================================================
The traditional model of project management works well in relatively simple and stable situations, but as complexity and uncertainty increase it starts to break down. Associate Professor Julien Pollack's research draws on systems thinking, complexity theory and change management in an effort to extend this model and enable practitioners to more effectively manage projects in complex, dynamic and sometimes unpredictable environments.
"The traditional model of project management tends to assume that our initial goals will remain valid throughout the project, and that we know enough at the outset to plan the whole project in detail.
"But project management is a dynamic activity, and a whole range of unexpected events can create complexity, uncertainty and the need for change and adaptation.
"Suppliers can run late or fail to deliver, clients can change their minds, design errors can become apparent, contractual ambiguities can surface, people can misunderstand each other, team members can unexpectedly move on, funding can evaporate with political change - even the strategic direction of the organisation can change, bringing the viability of the whole project into question.
"Given how turbulent the contexts of some projects are, it's sometimes a surprise that anything gets delivered at all.
"A huge amount of money is wasted when we attempt to use models of project management that don't suit the environments in which they are applied. However, my interest isn't just in the bottom line - it's in enabling people to do a better job, manage their work more effectively, achieve more, and get more out of the process.
"Part of my research aims to develop a model of project management that accommodates both linear and iterative approaches, accounting for periods of change and periods of efficient delivery.
"My ultimate goal is to change the way we think about projects and their management, and to develop techniques and frameworks that make a demonstrable difference to how groups of people come together in temporary organisational structures to manage and deliver discrete and unique pieces of work.
"I started working in this field in 2000. Between then and joining the University of Sydney in December 2016 I completed my PhD, delivered significant IT and organisational change projects for government, served as project manager and project office manager for a multibillion-dollar transport project, and led the project management program at another leading university."
Associate Professor Julien Pollack started working in project management in the Australian public sector delivering organizational change projects, where he completed an Action Research Ph.D. This research won national and international awards. Following this, he managed telecommunications and heavy engineering projects, before taking an academic position in 2011 to teach project management. He joined the University of Sydney in 2016. His research has focused on two broad themes: trends in project management research; and developing project management practice to meet the needs of projects that cannot be pre-defined in simple and stable terms. He has successively drawn on systems thinking, complexity theory, and change management to address this latter area of research, particularly focusing on the delivery of organisational change projects. His research in these areas has been frequently published in the leading project management journals and research conferences.

Professor Name: Josiah POON
=====================================================================================================
IT academics have been working with hospitals for decades to improve Western medicine. Dr Josiah Poon is working to do the same with Eastern medicine, by applying data mining and other IT techniques to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).
"The core of TCM is the interaction of herbs. There are many different combinations of herbs currently in use for each illness, and I develop algorithms using clinical records to try to discover the most effective treatments.
"I use a measurement called complementarity, which is found in economics. It works on the principle that the whole is larger than the sum of its parts - in this case, two separate herbs on their own may each do nothing, but when put together they may be a powerful treatment.
"My work with a hospital in Beijing has vastly improved the treatments available to its patients, and I am currently working with a research centre in Shanghai to quantify the effectiveness of the drugs it produces.
"While there are fewer TCM practitioners in Australia than there are in China, Australia is the first Western country to introduce the regulation of TCM through registration, which indicates the impact Chinese medicine is having on our health system.
"I am personally passionate about this area because I am from a Chinese background and I don't really see any difference between Western and Eastern medicine - they are both effective ways of aiming to cure illness. However, Eastern medicine tends to be seen as non-scientific, so I am using IT to build evidence of its scientific merit.
"I started working in this field in 2008, and have been at the University of Sydney since 2001. The Chinese Studies Centre here helps to promote this sort of work, which is fantastic."

Professor Name: Harry POULOS
=====================================================================================================
To say that Emeritus Professor Harry Poulos's career in foundation engineering has involved ensuring that buildings are properly supported on the ground they're built on so they won't collapse is not inaccurate, but this simple description belies the enormous contribution this distinguished engineer has made to his field. This is evidenced by the many awards and other forms of recognition he has received and the outstanding international reputation he has earned as a leader in both academia and industry.
"I specialise in the foundations of tall buildings, which are expensive to build, so my job involves not only making sure the supporting capacity of their foundations makes them safe, but also ensuring their economical feasibility for the owners of the building.
"Many of the buildings I've worked on have been overseas. For example, I was involved as a geotechnical peer reviewer in the design of the world's tallest building, Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Here in Australia I've worked on some high-rise buildings on the Gold Coast, but less so in Sydney, where structures are built on foundations of rock - which is much less interesting from my point of view.
"For many years I held dual roles in academia and industry, and that was probably the most productive time in my career. I supervised a number of research students, which enabled me to take genuine problems from industry and make them the focus of research projects, and then feed the results back into industry practice. I'm proud to say that a number of the practices developed in this way have now become routine in industry.
"The University of Sydney has really been the springboard of my career. I started my undergraduate degree here in the late 1950s and have since completed a PhD and a DScEng, worked in industry and progressed from the position of lecturer to professor to emeritus professor. While I've retired from the University now, I still give an occasional lecture to postgraduate students.
"Over my career I've also been fortunate to have been recognised for my work in various ways. Most recently, in 2010, I'm proud to have been the first Australian to become a Distinguished Member of the American Society of Civil Engineers, which recognises outstanding contributions of individuals to the field of civil engineering. It's very gratifying to be recognised in this way."

Professor Name: Jeremy QIU
=====================================================================================================
Low-carbon energy system planning
(e.g., optimal allocation of PV systems, energy storage systems, electric vehicles (EVs) and charging stations, hydrogen, etc.);
Data analytics in electricity markets
(e.g., non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), individualised utility functions and risk preferences, customer elasticity and rationality, privacy preservation);
Applied machine learning for energy economics
(e.g., deep convolutional neural network and deep reinforcement learning for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading, energy sharing, transactive energy, risk hedging);
Artificial intelligence (AI) applications in energy trading and pricing
(e.g., data-driven behavioural modelling, hybrid human-machine experiment, Human-in-the-Loop market simulations).
Dr Qiu joined the University of Sydney in November 2017, he is currently a Senior Lecturer in Electrical Engineering. Dr Qiu obtained his Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical and Control Engineering from Shandong University, China, M.Sc. degree in Environmental Policy and Management from The University of Manchester, UK, and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from The University of Newcastle, Australia, in 2008, 2010 and 2014 respectively. After submitting his PhD thesis, Dr Qiu worked as a full-time Research Associate between June 2014 and May 2016 at the
Centre for Intelligent Electricity Networks (CIEN)
, The University of Newcastle. Afterwards, Dr Qiu was appointed as an Energy Economics Scientist at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) between May 2016 and November 2017. Whilst at
CSIRO
, Dr Qiu was a project leader for several research initiatives, mainly in charge of modelling low-carbon energy transition.
The power energy sector is the largest source of emissions in Australia (about 180 Mt CO2-e per annum), accounting for over 30% of the total emissions. Consumers connected to the National Electricity Market are paying for a power grid about $90 billion today. Moreover, about 200 TWh of electricity with a market value of AU$17 billion was traded through the NEM, serving 9.7 million end-use consumers.
Dr Qiu’s expertise lies in energy planning and electricity markets, aiming to identify sustainable energy policy to enable Australia’s low-carbon transition towards energy sustainability. Energy planning means the process of developing long-range policies to help guide the future of a local, national, regional, or even the global energy system. Energy planning has played a strong role in setting the framework for regulations in the energy sector (for example, influencing what type of power plants might be built or what prices were charged for electricity). Sustainable energy planning takes a more holistic approach to the problem of planning for future energy needs. It is based on a structured decision-making process. Dr Qiu’s research aims to enhance the reliability and economic efficiency of our electricity supply networks, allowing them to reliably supply quality electricity in a more cost-effective and sustainable manner with advanced engineering and computational methods. This research area is of great significance, as it addresses the environmental impacts of energy consumption and production, particularly in light of the threat of global climate change, which is caused largely by emissions of greenhouse gases from the world's energy systems.
As an early career researcher, Dr Qiu has successfully attracted over $2.6million from the Australian Research Council, governments, and industry partners (including three ARC projects, one grant from the Australian Federal government, two grants from the State governments and 6 grants from the industry partners). These projects had made significant contributions to planning Australia’s transition to a lower emission energy future.

Sustainable energy planning takes a more holistic approach to the problem of planning for future energy needs. It is based on a structured decision-making process.The research of electricity markets (e.g., energy trading and pricing strategies) mainly evolves from three interdisciplinary elements: (1) electrical engineering, (2) energy economics, and (3) energy policy. Therefore, a good researcher in the field must have a wide range of experience with mathematical modelling, data science, optimisation, as well as expert knowledge in economics theories.

Dr Qiu's national and international impact in the energy planning filed can be evidenced by a number of facts, including invited paper submissions and keynote presentations, editorial board members in IEEE Transactions and IET journals, Best Paper Award in IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting 2014, CSIRO Team Performance Cash Award 2017 and acknowledgment from the Australian Prime Minister for research excellence. The Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP acknowledged that 'Australia needs a sustainable, practical and technology agnostic energy policy' and that Dr Qiu's research on the Electricity Network Transformation Roadmap at CSIRO 'will provide important input to the future of Australia's energy policy'.

Professor Name: Daniel QUEVEDO
=====================================================================================================
Prof Quevedo was drawn towards systems control, due to the wide applicability of systems thinking and feedback. Systems control tackles the interaction of the digital and the physical environment. Its power derives from employing suitable abstractions which allow one to design systems beyond disciplinary boundaries.
His initial research was confined to more traditional systems control problems, including control of power converters in conjunction with ABB Corporate Research in Switzerland. Motivated by the interconnectedness of our digital world, he became interested in networked cyberphysical systems and, more recently, cyberphysical systems with humans.
Through the integration of concepts from communications, cybersecurity, machine learning and behavioural economics, and using sophisticated mathematical tools, his research has greatly contributed to this emerging area.
Never resting and always wanting to learn and tackle new problems, he has consistently been reinventing his own research directions. Quevedo's research work has been driven by curiosity and enthusiasm for innovative ideas. He enjoys collaborating with colleagues from a number of disciplines, thus his research has benefited significantly from cross-fertilisation of ideas.
''Our century is bringing interesting challenges and opportunities that derive from the way that digital technology is shaping how we live as individuals and as a society. Addressing those issues naturally leads to the need to combine diverse expertise and mindsets.
Daniel Quevedo is Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of Sydney. Prior to his current appointment, he was with Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane and with Paderborn University Germany, where he established and led the Chair in Automatic Control. He received Ingeniero Civil Electrónico and MSc degrees from Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Valparaíso, Chile, in 2000, and in 2005 the PhD degree from the University of Newcastle, Australia. Daniel's research interests are in networked control systems, cyberphysical and human systems, cyberphysical security and control of power converters.
He serves as Associate Editor for
IEEE Transactions on Control of Networked Systems
, for
IEEE Control Systems
and in the Editorial Board of the
International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control
. From 2015 to 2018 he was Chair of the IEEE Control Systems Society Technical Committee on Networks & Communication Systems. Since 2023 he has served as a Member of the Committee of Experts and Excellence Commission for the Excellence Strategy of the German Federal and State Governments, representing “Digital Methods for Engineering Science”. In 2003 he received the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control Best Student Paper Award and was also a finalist in 2002. Prof Quevedo is co-recipient of the prestigious 2018
IEEE Transactions on Automatic Contro
l George S Axelby Outstanding Paper Award. He is a Fellow of the IEEE.

Professor Name: Yogambha RAMASWAMY
=====================================================================================================
Dr.Ramaswamy is a chemical engineer with a Master’s degree in Biotechnology from University of Queensland, and was awarded a PhD. in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Sydney in 2009. She then commenced her postdoctoral academic career as a Vice-Chancellor’s Post-Doctoral Research Fellow in the Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering at the University of New South Wales. She was then awarded the Peter Doherty Early Career Fellowship in 2013 and moved to University of Sydney in 2015. Since then, she has been involved in research, teaching and student supervision in the School of AMME.
Dr. Ramaswamy has developed a keen interest in the field of biomaterials and tissue engineering and has worked in this research area for over 10 years. She applies the principles of engineering and life sciences towards developing and characterising biomaterials such as bioceramics and biopolymers for hard and soft tissue applications. Her most significant contributions have been in developing and establishing the biological responses of bone cells (osteoblasts and osteoclasts) on calcium silicate based ceramics, rendered as a potential material for orthopedic applications. She has now extended her research interests in the emerging field of mechanobiology, where she is utilising biopolymer platforms to understand the role of physical cues in modulating the activity of stem cells and cancer cells. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms by which biological cells sense and respond to physical cues can lead to the development of novel treatments and therapies for a variety of diseases. Her overall goal is to be enthusiastic and committed to resolving some of the unanswered questions in mechanobiology and biomaterials using innovative ideas that can eventually lead to the betterment of society and improve the quality of life.

Professor Name: Mohsen RAMEZANI
=====================================================================================================
Traffic congestion is a major problem in many large urban centres. More than just an inconvenience to commuters themselves, it affects the air we all breathe and the overall quality of our lives. Dr Mohsen Ramezani's research aims to mitigate the problem of urban traffic congestion and its associated implications for the broader community.
"Transport systems are the backbone of infrastructure, and efficient and sustainable mobility solutions can lead to substantial benefits in terms of time, energy, air and noise pollution, safety, and quality of life. Traffic congestion is the major problem my research aims to mitigate, through outcomes that will support the decision-making processes of road authorities. My aim is to develop novel mobility solutions to provide more efficient, sustainable, equitable, cheaper, cleaner and safer transport systems for people and goods. My long-term goal is to integrate cutting-edge technologies to enhance the transport experience of everyday people.
"My research is quantitative, and is based on the physical modelling of traffic flow dynamics, big data analytics, fostering of emerging technologies and advanced mathematical tools. It involves developing multi-scale and multimodal traffic control schemes to achieve holistic traffic congestion management systems to address the entire extent and complexity of the transport network.
"I am passionate about this field of research because it is dynamic, challenging, community oriented and multidisciplinary, and it occurs at the intersection of science and engineering. It also results in tangible, direct and significant benefits to society. The main challenging is modelling and addressing the dynamic behaviour and decision-making processes of human beings as the main part of any complex transport system."
Dr. Mohsen Ramezani received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering (control systems) from the University of Tehran, Iran, in 2008 and 2010, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in Transportation from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland. Prior to joining the School of Civil Engineering at the University of Sydney in 2016, he was a Lecturer at the Institute of Transport Studies at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia (2015-2016).

Professor Name: Fabio RAMOS
=====================================================================================================
In recent years we've seen a proliferation of sensors and embedded computer systems in everyday devices, capable of capturing vast amounts of information in almost all areas of human activity - cars with GPSs and reverse-parking sensors, mobile phones with integrated cameras, outdoor lights that automatically come on at dusk. But the ready availability of such information does not ensure its efficient use, or that of the device that captures it. Professor Fabio Ramos' research aims to address this issue.
"For many years I've been intrigued with how humans can process so much information so quickly through their natural senses of vision, hearing, smell and so on. In an unconscious manner, everything we perceive is combined to create a seamless interpretation of our current environment or situation.
"I've been trying to replicate these capabilities in machines - from autonomous cars that can drive themselves to iron ore mines with multiple heavy automated vehicles and, in a new and exciting project, geophysical data collected from the entire continent being fused together to estimate potential locations for geothermal power plants.
"There's a lot of data out there. How best to make sense of it while understanding the relationships between different natural phenomena is what excites me about my research.
"One of my ultimate goals is to develop a robot that can learn about the world by experience, as a child does in the early stages of life. I'd also like to develop devices to help people with cognitive impairment (such as from dementia) to regain some of their independence.
"I've been working in this field since in 1997, and joined the University of Sydney in 2003. Through the Centre for Translational Data Science and the Australian Centre for Field Robotics, the University has given me excellent opportunities to develop my career."
Fabio Ramos is a Professor of Robotics and Machine Learning in the School of Computer Science, University of Sydney. He received a B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Mechatronics Engineering at University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, in 2001 and 2003 respectively, and a Ph.D. at University of Sydney, Australia, in 2008. From 2008 to 2010 he was an ARC postdoctoral fellow and from 2012 to 2014 an ARC DECRA fellow. He has over 100 peer-reviewed publications and received numerous awards. His research focuses on statistical machine learning techniques for large-scale data fusion with applications in robotics, mining, environmental monitoring and healthcare.

Professor Name: Kim RASMUSSEN
=====================================================================================================
A fascination with structures buckling under pressure has led to a distinguished career in the design, analysis and testing of metal structures for stability for Professor Kim Rasmussen. A world-leading researcher in the field, Professor Rasmussen's work is making the metal structures that surround us - from high-rise office buildings to houses to industrial shelving and scaffolding - safer, more efficient and more economical.
"I've always been fascinated by buckling. The notion that something can be geometrically perfect but then when you put a small additional load on it the whole thing suddenly buckles is just fascinating to me. And we can now analyse and predict this behaviour with a great degree of confidence".
"I research efficient ways of designing metal structures. These include the steel 'skeletons' of buildings, which need to carry the weight of the building as well as bearing the load of wind, earthquakes and so on. I also work with structures such as scaffolding and steel storage racks used in warehouses. Racks are challenging to design because they're built as lightly as possible but are very heavily loaded, and they can and do collapse for a range of reasons. My research aims to determine the forces leading to these collapses and better design these structures accordingly.
“In recent years, I’ve become interested in the mechanical properties and behaviour of 3D printed metal structures as well as the ductile fracture of metal structures. Fracture of metal structures is challenging to predict with confidence but significant advances have been made in recent years to create computational models that accurately predict the initiation and propagation of fracture in steel structures. My research group has a particular focus on fracture initiating in the heat-affected zone of welds.
Kim Rasmussen is Challis Professor of Civil Engineering in the School of Civil Engineering. He obtained his Masters of Science in Engineering from the Technical University of Denmark, and his PhD and higher doctorate (DEng) from the University of Sydney. He joined the School of Civil Engineering in 1989, and served as Head of School from 2005 until 2016. He was Deputy Dean and Associate Dean Research from 2016 to 2022, and acted as Interim Dean from 1 Jan 2018 to 30 June 2018.
He is a member and past chairman of the
Centre for Advanced Structural Engineering

Professor Name: Simon RINGER
=====================================================================================================
Professor Ringer's research is about atomic-scale materials design. He uses a materials science and engineering approach to learn how small groups of atoms in special architectures—atomic clusters—can create materials with remarkable properties. New combinations of electronic, magnetic, chemical and mechanical properties are being discovered with applications in semiconductors for photovoltaics and communications, catalysis, and new lightweight metal alloys of aluminium, magnesium, titanium alloys, and advanced structural steels. He uses insights from atomic-resolution electron microscopy and atom probe microscopy to create 'designer microstructures' with special interfaces, dopant distributions, atomic clusters and nanoscale particles. As represented in the graphic below, these are the 'tools' for microstructural design.
A particular interest for Professor Ringer is in 'property conflicts'. In many instances in materials engineering, we require a profile of materials properties such that some of the properties may be in conflict with each other. Examples are strength and ductility—usually materials exhibit one, or the other—but in practice, we desire both. Other examples include superconductivity and magnetism, and semiconductivity and certain other electrical and mechanical properties can be difficult to balance. Resolving or minimising property conflicts so as to achieved balanced materials properties is a great challenge in materials design and represents an ultimate goal of the microstructural engineering that Professor Ringer and his team are researching.
Research case study: advanced steels
Professor Ringer's team are at the forefront of the design and development of so-called third-generation advanced high strength steels. They have created novel steel chemistries and novel thermomechanical processing routes that achieve extraordinary mechanical properties. The innovation is truly significant. Reducing the weight of a car by 100 kg reduce CO2 emissions by about six grams per kilometre driven, and fuel usage by about half a litre of fuel per 100 km. Extrapolated globally, the potential impact would be gigatonnes of CO2 emissions, gigalitres of fuel and vast amounts of particulates that are not released into the atmosphere. The health implications around light-weighting are also enormous. Some of the work was recently summarised in MRS Bulletin. Basically, the team have achieved controlled partitioning of manganese across austenite-ferrite phase interfaces so as to 'prime' the austenite with just the right amount of metastability as to render is prone to both transformation induced plasticity and twin induced plasticity mechanisms. Professor Ringer's team are leaders in the science of atom probe microscopy and the insights gained from this technique have been a critical enabler for this research on advanced steels
Research case study: new approaches to computer memory
As published recently in
Physical Review Letters
, Professor Ringer and his team have used a finely focused beam of electrons rastered across a special ceramic material, to pave the way towards a new paradigm for increasing the memory capacity of computer hard drives.
Responding to consumer demand for increased computer hard drive memory, the research also has the potential to reduce the environmental footprint of the more than 2.5 billion hard drives currently estimated to be in use worldwide.
If you lined up all the world's hard drives back-to-back, they would go around the globe 5 times, and hard drives are partly manufactured from non-biodegradable aluminium and other metals. This project focussed on the materials science for memory storage. In some oxide ceramics called ferroelectric materials, there exist tiny domains that can that contain an electric dipole that is switchable. Two opposite dipole directions can be used as the two logic signals '0' and '1', so that they can serve as memory bits. The key challenge is how to 'set' the domains to one condition or the other, and how to 'switch' the domains once written. Conventional techniques use local heating, mechanical stress or electrical bias—all of which have major drawbacks. Zibin Chen (PhD student) and Professor Liao (Sydney) discovered that a high-energy electron beam with an omni-directional electric field does the job!
This approach could reduce the current memory domain size by 100 times, resulting in a 100 times greater data storage capability.
Professor Ringer explains: "As materials engineers, we think a lot about how to stimulate local changes in the atomic-scale structure of materials so as to access remarkable new properties and behaviour. We are really excited to have discovered that applying these local electric fields with nanoscale precision can create a new paradigm for computer memory."
Research case study: nanoelectronics
Professor Ringer's team are driving the design and development of nanowires forward, with new insights to improve the efficient and cost-effective production of these building blocks of nanoelectronics. Ternary InGaAs nanowires made from Indium (In), Gallium (Ga) and Arsenic (As) from the III-V group of the periodic table are highly 'tunable' in terms of their electron properties such as band gap. For example, we can dope them with particular elements in the growth stage to change electrical properties, or change the growth conditions to vary their shape or size. Their semiconducting properties make them attractive for applications in optoelectronics, thermoelectrics, and photovoltaics. The team's work is focussed on controlling the growth and properties of the semiconductor nanowires, which are regarded as the next generation building blocks for the future of electronics. As part of a longstanding successful collaboration with colleagues at ANU, Professor Ringer and colleagues (A/Prof. Rongkun Zheng in Physics and Ph.D. student, Jiangtao Qu) are unlocking mechanisms of how the vapour-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism for fabricating nanowires actually works. Professor Ringer, says: " These unprecedented 3D insights into the nanowires enable deeper understanding of nanowire growth and the growth-structure-property relationships." "This a marvellous scientific achievement that places Sydney uniquely at the forefront of III-V semiconductor nanowire design and development. These materials will be driving all sorts of nanoelectronics technology into the future." This work was published in Advanced Materials in 2017.
Academic Leadership
The University of Sydney is strongly committed to bold, multi-disciplinary research. We support this in three ways. Firstly, we have established a number of Multi-Disciplinary Research Centres. For example, our Charles Perkins Centre, Brain and Mind Centre, and the Australian Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology, are transforming the science and technology in challenges spaces such as obestity, diabetes, neuroscience and communications. Secondly, we have established seven Core Research Facilities that provide world-class platforms for our researchers and our partners. Cytometry, informatics, mass spectrometry, microscopy, nanofabrication, spectroscopy and, most recently, biomedical imaging are our focus capability areas. Thirdly, we are committed to the establishment of Enterprise Partnerships that align our research capability for maximum leverage and impact.
Professor Ringer leads the Core Research Facilities program and as such leads the strategic planning and implementation of the program. His team are working to ensure that Sydney's peak research infrastructure is truly world-class. This effort contributes to the University's capacity to achieve our strategic plan 2016-2020 because research infrastructure is a prime determinant of our ability to undertake world-leading research. The way that we choose to respond to the most significant challenges of our time, around climate, health, food, water, energy, communications, transport, manufacturing, construction and national security will largely define our future as an institution.
In operating a Core Research Facilities Program, we create platforms that transform our research capability and enable our institutional aspirations. This leadership role necessarily has interfaces with the various parts of the University of Sydney—particularly Westmead, North Shore and Camden, as well as our various partners including ANSTO, Sydney Health Partners, and the State Government of NSW. Professor Ringer works to also ensure that Sydney is positioned to play a national leadership role through the Core Research Facilities program, via engagement with the national research infrastructure strategy and the University is a leader in many of Australia's national research facilities.
Professor Simon Ringer is the University of Sydney’s Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Research Infrastructure) and leads the University's strategic planning and operations of its high-end research infrastructure initiatives. He is a Professor of Materials Science and Engineering in the School of Aerospace, Mechanical & Mechatronic Engineering, and an academic member of the Australian Centre for Microscopy & Microanalysis.
He has worked in Sweden, Japan, the USA and Australia, and holds patents in the design of steels and nanomaterials. He has published over 100 papers and serves as a materials engineering consultant to local and international industry.

Professor Name: Mohammad SAADATFAR
=====================================================================================================
My research has been focused on understanding the structure-property relationship of meso-scale materials. Meso-scale materials typically possess intrinsic structures which are orders of magnitude larger than atomic or molecular scales but smaller than scales familiar to everyday human experience. This class of materials include for instance bone, wood, carbon fibre composites, geomaterials and rocks. Understanding the behaviour of meso-scale materials requires cross disciplinary approach at the interface of physics, engineering, mathematics and biology. In my approach I combine experiments with simulations and modelling to enable solving real world problems encountered in environmental science (CO2geo-sequestration), bio-medical engineering (bone implant) and the design of advanced materials (mechanical meta-materials).
Area of research interests: Soft matter physics (cellular solids, granular materials, physics and engineering of biological systems). Design optimisation (topological materials, mechanical meta-material, structure-property relationship, tomographic imaging, FE simulations and forward modelling, geological CO2 storage).

Professor Name: Aaron SCHINDELER
=====================================================================================================
A/Prof Schindeler has a diverse range of research interests across the fields of medicine, health, and engineering. Key focus areas include the development of novel tools for functional genomics and gene therapy for bone fragility disorders; pharmaceutical modulation of bone healing; bone tissue engineering using novel biomaterials and 3D printing; and treating the musculoskeletal complications associated with Neurofibromatosis type 1.
“My research aims to target major problems affecting children’s health. To accomplish this, I am working to create new tools for understanding the mechanisms of disease and subsequent disease treatment. In some cases we are repurposing old drugs, in other cases we are designing new drugs as well as new gene editing strategies using technologies such as CRISPR.
“One example of the timeline of such research can be seen in the treatment of the genetic disease neurofibromatosis type I or NF1. Children with this condition have a broad range of complications, but my work has focused on those affecting muscle and bone. Together with my colleagues we found that other drugs used for treatment of non-unions combined with adult osteoporosis drugs could reduce the number of amputations seen in children with crippling bone non-unions. More recently, we found that specific over-the-counter dietary supplements were able to effectively treat muscle weakness in a preclinical model, and this work has now moved into clinical trials.
“Another exciting advance is how we are using CRISPR gene editing to develop functional genomics methods to identify causes of bone disease in hospital patients. However the real challenge will be to then find ways to repair these mutations. Recently we had a major advance, developing an adeno-associated viral vector system that specifically targets the bone and that can affect gene editing throughout the skeleton with a single injection. While there is a lot of work to be done before we can cure genetic bone diseases, this is a critical first step.”
A/Prof Schindeler heads the Bioengineering & Molecular Medicine laboratory at The Children’s Hospital at Westmead and the Westmead Institute for Medical Research. He holds an academic position in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (Faculty of Engineering).
He leads a multidisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, and health professionals that tackle major clinical issues affecting children’s musculoskeletal health and genetic disease. He has a strong research track record with 120+ peer-review publications and eight NHMRC project grants, and an ARC Linkage Grant.
A/Prof Schindeler has been working at The Children’s Hospital at Westmead since 2003, after completing his PhD at the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute.

Professor Name: Suranga SENEVIRATNE
=====================================================================================================
With billions of devices and users all over the world now connected to the internet, and this number increasing exponentially, protecting the security and privacy of internet users has never been more critical. This is the important area on which Dr Suranga Seneviratne’s research focuses.
“While the internet has made our lives easier in many ways, it also comes with some associated risks. In the past few years alone we’ve witnessed significant data breaches, botnets in operation, cyberterrorism activities and distributed denial of services at scales never seen before. Ongoing advances in artificial intelligence also equip attackers with increasingly sophisticated tools that can be leveraged to launch novel and resilient attacks.
“My research looks at how to secure networked systems and end-user devices from cyberattack. The main challenge in doing this is the trade-off between the usability and the level of security – it’s not practical to develop highly secure systems if they force additional usability overheads onto the user.
“Cybersecurity has always been an arms race between the attackers and the researchers. As security researchers, we need to identify vulnerabilities and potential threats before they are exploited, and come up with countermeasures when attackers change their strategies. I enjoy this continuous challenge of working in network security, and its very dynamic nature.
“Some of the applications of my research include more usable authentication systems. For example, I’m currently working on novel and ubiquitous behaviour biometrics that will enable intrusion-free sensing and thus allow users to authenticate without any password or security token.
“I’ve also developed an app for mobile devices that provides a five-star security rating for apps installed on the device and suggests secure alternatives to any riskier or more vulnerable apps that users have installed.
“I have been working in network security since 2011, and I joined the University of Sydney in 2017.
“I envision a future where we can use the internet seamlessly and pervasively without worrying about security and privacy.”
Dr Suranga Seneviratne is a Senior Lecturer in Security at the School of Computer Science, The University of Sydney. He received his PhD from University of New South Wales, Australia in 2015. His current research interests include privacy and security in mobile systems, AI applications in security, and behaviour biometrics. Before moving into research, he worked nearly six years in the telecommunications industry in core network planning and operations. He received his bachelor degree from University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka in 2005.

Professor Name: Luming SHEN
=====================================================================================================
Clean water is a global issue: its availability is essential to human and other forms of life. One of Associate Professor Luming Shen's current research projects involves working at nano-scale to develop a carbon nanotubes membrane to filter small particles from water in order to purify it. This will have implications for people around the world, enabling clean water to be derived from otherwise unsafe sources.
"My work involves researching the mechanics and behaviours of materials, including brittle materials such as concrete, rock and glass as well as ductile materials such as aluminium, titanium and other metals.
"Two of my current focuses are on nano-mechanics and materials, which relates to the water purification example, and the behaviour of novel composite materials under impact and other extreme loading conditions, which has safety applications within such contexts as the design of blast-resistant structures and vehicle impact studies.
"A lot of my work is carried out using a high-performance supercomputer, including modelling and simulation at molecular level as well as macro-level analyses. I also work in a laboratory, where I conduct physical tests on materials such as rock, metals and composites under high-speed impact.
"My research is mainly fundamental. I'm trying to develop our understanding of the physics behind these phenomena. This knowledge will then be able to be used in real-world applications such as desalinating water, improving vehicle safety and controlling rock fragmentation in mining.
"I've been working in this field for about 10 years, and joined the University of Sydney about five years ago. The School of Civil Engineering in particular has been very supportive of my research, especially in terms of facilities and equipment. My research takes space, and the equipment I use is quite large. The University has provided me with the space and facilities I need to pursue my research."

Professor Name: Salah SUKKARIEH
=====================================================================================================
Robotics is a field that has captured the public imagination, with numerous books, films and television programs featuring improbably intelligent machines with seemingly unlikely capabilities. Professor Salah Sukkarieh's research into robotics and intelligent systems is the real thing, and it's not too far from those products of our collective imagination.
"My work involves developing robotic devices and intelligent systems that can operate 24/7 in outdoor environments. These are devices that can perceive and understand their environment, make informed decisions about any actions required and then carry out those actions - all without direct human input.
"For example, my colleagues and I have already developed an automated berth in Brisbane where ships are loaded and unloaded by robotic devices without direct human involvement. We're also working with Rio Tinto on establishing an autonomous mine operation in the Pilbara region of Western Australia; we've developed pilotless robotic aircraft that can detect and spray invasive weeds in remote locations; and we're currently working on autonomous devices that will perform many of the manual tasks involved in large-scale agricultural production.
"I'm also developing intelligent software systems for autonomous decision making. We're already seeing applications for this technology in commercial aviation and environmental management, and its potential for use in other areas is significant.
"All of these projects represent vast improvements in human safety as well as in efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
"I'm passionate about developing this kind of high-end technology and supporting its adoption, because it has a significant and immediate impact on industry and the wider community - it really is transformational.
"I've been working in this field for over 20 years. Having completed my own degrees at the University of Sydney, I then returned to join the staff. It's a great environment, it's local to the main industry players and we have excellent student cohorts."
Salah Sukkarieh is the Professor of Robotics and Intelligent Systems at the University of Sydney. He was awarded the NSW Science and Engineering Award for Excellence in Engineering and Information and Communications Technologies in 2014; one of Australia’s Most Innovative Engineers by Engineers Australiain 2016; in 2017 the CSIRO Eureka Prize for Leadership in Innovation and Science, one of 11 Launch Food Innovators worldwide, and the AFR True Leaders Game Changer; and in 2019 was nominated as one of the 2019 NSW Australian of the Year, as well as being recognised by Engineers Australia’s as one of their Centenary Heroes. Salah is a Fellow of Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (ATSE) and IEEE Senior Member. He has over 500 academic and industry publications in robotics and intelligent systems. From 2019-2022 he was the CEO of Agerris, an Agtech startup company spun out of the ACFR, where he led the manufacturing and commercialisation of on-farm robotic solutions to improve agricultural productivity and environmental sustainability. He was the Director Research and Innovation at the Australian Centre for Field Robotics from 2007-2018, where he led the strategic research and industry engagement program in the world's largest field robotics institute. Salah has received over $50min university-industry-government research grants in the last ten years, and is recognised as an international expert in the research, development and commercialisation of field robotic systems. He has led a number of robotics and intelligent systems R&D projects in logistics (Patrick Stevedores), commercial aviation (Qantas), aerospace (various national and international agencies), education (Australian Government), environment monitoring (Australian Government), agriculture (horticulture, grains, meat and livestock) and mining (Rio Tinto).

Professor Name: Michael SWAIN
=====================================================================================================
Professor Swain studies the ultrastructure of biomaterials including advanced ceramics and explores the effects of inert and biological microstructure on the biomaterial’s clinical properties. As caries remains a major problem, these materials and their properties are vital for developing effective dental restorative treatment. Additional research interests include nano-mechanical properties of teeth, natural calcified tissue, carious lesions in enamel and dentine and bone remodeling and dentine repair. “The aim of my work is to improve healthcare practice in dentistry”, says Professor Swain, “I am interested in examining the clinical correlations of
in vitro
data, developing better dental restorative materials and techniques and in increasing our understanding of the biology of dental restoration and tooth disease, with the objective that dentists might one day be able to discard the drill”.
Research projects include the study of bone remodeling associated with dental restorative treatments including implants (collaboration with Professor Qing Li, Faculty of Engineering); the impact of loading of soft tissues on the underlying hard tissue response; the use of classical fracture mechanics-based concepts to characterise adhesion and bonding of dental materials (from porcelain-bonded ceramics to zirconia to composites bonding to enamel and dentine); study of advanced dental ceramics for restorative applications; characterising restorative materials likely to be most appropriate for minimal-intervention dentistry; assessing the influence of caries on enamel and dentine by quantifying mineral densities in natural teeth and carious lesions, and investigating options for caries treatment through remineralisation of enamel and dentine; exploring the structural consequences of bleaching on enamel; modeling of prosthodontic structures; and quantification of remnant proteins in molar-incisor hypertrophy (in collaboration with paediatric dentist Dr Nicky Kilpatrick at the Murdoch Institute in Melbourne); Recently, he worked with colleagues at the University of Freiburg, Germany, on studies of static and dynamic response of cells in a bioreactor, and contact-deformation of eye tissue.
Professor Michael (Mike) Swain is an internationally renowned ceramic scientist who heads the Faculty of Dentistry’s Biomaterials Research Unit. He was conjoint Professor of Biomaterials at the University of Otago, New Zealand (until 2013). Professor Swain has a background in Applied Physics specialising in Materials Science, particularly glass and ceramics. He leads a broad research program exploring the role of biomaterial microstructures (inert and biological) on the subsequent clinical properties of the biomaterial (particularly advanced ceramics). He also is interested in the correlation between the microstructures’ biological properties and the clinical behaviour of the systems in which the biomaterials are used (e.g. the tooth cavity or orthopaedics). His research team studiesdental restorative materials, biomaterials and biomechanics, as well as normal and diseased teeth. “Dentists are oral engineers”, says Professor Swain “and it is imperative they understand the mechanics and properties of the materials used in their daily work. Questions such as what are the stresses and strains that might increase the likelihood of chipping or fracture of dental restorative materials, or how does a tooth and soft tissue behave around an implant, are fundamentally important”.Professor Swain received the 2013 Richard Brook Award from the European Ceramic Society for his work on zirconia. This prestigious award is bestowed biennially, to a scientist outside Europe who has been a major and consistent contributor to Ceramic Science. It is the society’s only award to a non-European scientist. Professor Swain has served as an expert consultant to a 2003 UN special commission to investigate the
in vivo
failure of >500 zirconia hip joints. His prolific research publication record includes a single-author paper in
Nature
. His 2013 paper (with Professor Qing Li) relating to fracture resistance of titanium and zirconia abutments has been downloaded >1,000 times. Professor Swain is listed as an inventor on four patents.
Professor Swain collaborates widely in Australia and internationally, in disciplines within and outside of dentistry. He frequently presents lectures to specialist clinicians such as endodontists and prosthodontists, on topics including teeth fracture, dental restoration, and advanced dental ceramics. In his spare time Professor Swain can be found cycling in the Australian outback experiencing “the real Australia” or wandering in the high Alps “looking for inspiration”.

Professor Name: Kanchana THILAKARATHNA
=====================================================================================================
While the majority of us now carry at least one smart mobile device with us every day, few of us are fully aware of the cost of this convenience in terms of exposing our personal information to third parties. Dr Kanchana Thilakarathna’s research aims to improve our security and privacy in this regard.
“Smart devices – such as smartphones, tablets, smartwatches and other wearables – have literally changed human lifestyles, providing endless innovative services in every aspect of our life. I am passionate about their ever-growing capabilities to take human experience far beyond expectations.
“But while we enjoy many of these services ‘for free’, they come at the cost of these devices having the ability to continuously monitor, store and transmit sensitive personal information to third parties, such as service providers.
“Most users are unaware of exactly what information service providers are collecting about them, and the majority of providers currently gather information without properly informing users or giving them an alternative.
“It is technically challenging to provide secure, private and efficient services on top of these resource-constrained devices, especially with limited battery life and without negatively impacting the cost or usability of these services.
“My research aims to develop distributed computing platforms that exploit the computational, storage and energy resources available on and around the personal area to provide safe, secure, private, useful and efficient services to mobile users.
“One example of my work is a social media app I developed called Yalut, which enables users to retain control over their own photos, videos and other content. Users keep their content on their own devices and, when they choose to share some of it with online friends – whether through Yalut or an existing social media platform – it is uploaded directly to their friends’ devices, so that it is now only on their own and their friends’ devices.
“My aim is to develop mobile apps such as these and make them available to everyone.
“I’ve been working in this field since 2010, and joined the University of Sydney in 2017.”
Dr Kanchana Thilakarathna is a Senior Lecturer in Distributed Computing at the School of Computer Science, The University of Sydney and is a member of the Centre for Distributed and High Performance Computing.
Prior to joining the University of Sydney, Kanchana was a Research Scientist at the Networks Group, Cyber-Physical Systems Research Program at Data61-CSIRO and previously NICTA during Nov 2014 - Aug 2017.

Professor Name: Nguyen TRAN
=====================================================================================================
With more and more training data and computing power responsibilities shifting to edge nodes, Dr Nguyen Tran's research involves optimising edge network performance while protecting user data privacy.
"With the emergence of edge computing and the next generation of wireless networks, we need a solid theoretical and interdisciplinary approach to tackle the complex dynamics of practical design for the underlying networks.
"My research employs tools such as stochastic modelling, queueing theory, optimisation theory and game theory to design, analyse and optimise the cutting-edge applications used in complex networks such as edge computing, 5G network resource allocation and distributed machine learning for wireless networks.
"Traditionally, in-network communications and computation capabilities were separated: the communication phase occurred at the edge, while the computation phase needed to be executed at central data centres. However, what currently interests me is how to design joint communication and computation at the edge that will not only improve network performance but also reduce the bottleneck at centralised data centres and alleviate the data privacy issue.
"For example, while machine learning algorithms have traditionally been 'trained' using globally and centrally gathered data, some of this training could in fact be performed by sets of individual users' mobile devices with their own separate data.
"However, individual users are reluctant to provide their devices for public network tasks that don't directly benefit them - even though most of the time these powerful devices are idle, which can be considered wasteful.
"So my research develops practical, robust, and scalable algorithms to solve the problem of how to incentivise users to participate in the common tasks of performing training in a distributed manner, which requires computing power and data from users, while preserving their privacy.
"The ultimate objective is to guarantee a provably efficient performance of the designed algorithm. The challenge in this case is to align the different personal preferences of individual users to achieve a common network goal, where all network entities are happy and the overall network performance is optimal or quantifiably near-optimal."
Nguyen H. Tran (S'10-M'11) received the BS degree from Hochiminh City University of Technology and Ph.D degree from Kyung Hee University, in electrical and computer engineering, in 2005 and 2011, respectively.

Professor Name: Marjorie VALIX
=====================================================================================================
Corrosion caused by acid-generating micro-organisms causes billions of dollars’ worth of damage to infrastructure every year. I research this natural process with a view to mitigating its effects - and harnessing it for more constructive purposes.
Certain micro-organisms can generate destructive acids that attack particular materials and cause damaging and costly corrosion. In Australia alone, our water authorities spend more than $3 billion each year tackling this issue.
Developing our understanding of microbially induced corrosion can help us to prevent or slow it, through such means as using protective coatings to hinder its progress. I have been driving holistic approaches to enable effective decisions, such as asset prioritisation of the assets to rehabilitate to selection of technologies to control corrosion, that balances risk, cost, and benefits.
But this same destructive process also has great constructive potential that can be used to address major global challenges such as climate change and environmental risks. By understanding the natural ability of micro-organisms to break down materials, I have developed technologies to harness this behaviour to remine metals including critical metals from mining wastes and metallic wastes such as e-waste or waste batteries in a cost-effective and ecologically sensitive manner. My research is also developing technologies using micro-organisms to effectively and rapidly use mining wastes in carbon dioxide removal as carbon sink.
Unlike chemicals, micro-organisms can be 'trained' to tolerate toxic environments and to generate specific enzymes that catalyse degradation of certain materials. Learning how to harness this behaviour is exciting.
Translating research outcomes to implementable solutions is a complex process. To achieve this, I have been collaborating and interacting with diverse group of experts who works on various aspects of business risk modelling, sensing, structural and corrosion from within the University of Sydney, external Universities, government institutions and industries including established and green field mining, water utilities, peak bodies, roads and transport and material manufacturers.
I have been working in this field since 1998. Being at the University of Sydney is very conducive to my research, because of its world-leading facilities and researchers.

Professor Name: Andre VAN RENSSEN
=====================================================================================================
Dr André van Renssen's research focuses on calculating the shortest possible paths through various types of networks - from computer and communications networks to road and other transport networks. By designing routing algorithms that can perform this task quickly and efficiently, he aims to help alleviate both information and vehicle traffic congestion without the need to build more roads or add more cables.
"The main purpose of the networks I study is to allow either information or traffic to move from one node (location) to another. So we need to find the shortest paths between the various nodes. My research focuses on designing efficient algorithms that can determine which node to direct information or traffic to so it reaches its destination in the shortest possible time.
"The problem of finding the fastest route between two locations depends on the state of the network. If there's a lot of communication or traffic over a certain cable or road, additional traffic that intends to use this route will have to wait its turn. This can be solved by adding more cables or building more or wider roads, but that approach is both expensive and impractical. By designing better routing algorithms, I hope to help alleviate these problems without the need to add new cables or roads.
"The time it takes to get from one location to another may also vary depending on the time or day of the week. During rush hour it might be better to take a longer route using side roads than to take the shortest route, which might be fine on weekends. Other factors, such as lanes being closed due to an accident or construction work, must also be taken into account by the algorithm.
"Results from this kind of research are already being used in, for example, the navigation function of Google Maps, which updates routes when a certain road is congested. I hope my work will lead to even fewer or shorter delays in the future.
"I've been working in this field since around 2010, and I joined the University of Sydney in 2018. I'm very eager to start working with my colleagues here and to expand my research."

Professor Name: Gregor VERBIC
=====================================================================================================
According to Professor Gregor Verbic, solving the sustainable energy supply puzzle holds the key to the prosperity of humankind. As many in the community are aware, our current reliance on fossil fuels needs to be replaced with a renewable alternative - not only because using fossil fuels cause global warming, but also because we are about to run out of cheap fossil fuels. Finding a technically sound and socially acceptable solution is the focus of Associate Professor Verbic's research.
"My research aims to find ways of harnessing the untapped potential of distributed energy resources connected at lower voltage levels - including small-scale distributed generation, energy storage systems, electric vehicles and smart appliances - to be used as a system resource, which will make it possible for us to transform our fossil fuel-based electricity supply into a more sustainable one based on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar.
"A good example is energy management in residential buildings. Many Australians have solar panels installed on their roofs, and use mains power as a back-up. With improved energy storage and a home energy management system, they'll be able to reshape their energy consumption pattern to avoid using mains electricity when it's most expensive. Network operators will benefit from the more efficient use of resources and reduced peak demand, and users will have more control over their energy expenditure by being able to use energy more economically.
"My work is contributing towards the transformation of our current electricity infrastructure into a 'smart', electronically automated system that delivers services to customers more economically and with improved energy efficiency. My ultimate goal is to enable zero-carbon grids with minimal impact to society.
"I've been working in this field since the late 1990s, and joined the University of Sydney in 2010. My main reason for coming here was to find a productive and encouraging academic environment, and this has turned out to be a real boost to my research."
Gregor Verbic is a Professor and Director of the
Centre for Future Energy Networks
based in the
School of Electrical and Computer Engineering
. Prior to this, he was an assistant professor in
Laboratory of Power Systems
at University of Ljubljana, where he received his PhD in electrical engineering. In 2005, he was a NATO-NSERC Postdoctoral Fellow at the
University of Waterloo, Canada
under supervision of Prof Claudio Cañizares. Between 2008 and 2010 he was Head of the Investment Department in Interenergo, Ljubljana, Slovenia. The company invests in renewable energy in the Balkans region.
Gregor's major research contribution is his novel method for voltage instability prediction based on local voltage and current phasors. As opposed to the majority of other methods that treat the system as a whole, Gregor's approach needs only the information that is readily available at every bus in the system equipped with a phasor measurement unit. There are several advantages to this unique approach, most notably computational efficiency and no need for a communication link with the control centre. This research resulted in the
IEEE prize paper award in 2006
.
Gregor's research focus later shifted to electricity markets including the pricing of power-reserves for frequency control and transmission service pricing. During his time at University of Waterloo in Canada, Gregor developed novel methods and tools to better represent system uncertainties in auction models used in electricity markets, to study the effect of these uncertainties in pricing and dispatch. His subsequent research looked at developing new methods and tools for stochastic optimisation of multi-energy carrier systems, including variable renewable energy sources and hydrogen.
His current research is motivated by the evolution of power systems to future grids, dominated by variable renewables. Drawing on his expertise in power-system operation, dynamics and control, electricity markets, applied optimisation and probabilistic analysis, he is aiming to develop tools and methods that will enable a paradigm shift in power system operation, from generation following load to load following generation.
Recently, Gregor has focused on aggregation and control of distributed energy resources (DERs) at the residential level, including smart appliances and electric vehicles, proposing ways for DERs to be used in balancing the increasingly volatile generation. He is concentrating on scalable control algorithms enabling seamless integration and plug and play functionality. Gregor is also interested in wind power integration, focusing of ancillary services, mostly frequency control, and market implications. He and his students proposed a novel control algorithm that enables participation of wind generation in system support by providing frequency regulation capability. The need for de-loaded operation is significantly reduced by (intelligent) use of the kinetic energy of the rotating masses.
Gregor serves as a reviewer in numerous high ranking journals in the area of power and energy systems. He is a senior member of the

Professor Name: Daniele VIGOLO
=====================================================================================================
Daniele’s main research interests are in the field of soft matter, complex fluids and bio-microfluidics. He aims to answers fundamental inter-disciplinary questions in micro-fluid dynamics of multiphase flows and transport phenomena in non-equilibrium systems in the presence of temperature gradients (i.e., thermophoresis).
He is in particular interested in applications of microfluidics to biological and health related problems. Daniele and his group study bio-fluid dynamics with the aim to predict and prevent the insurgence of diseases such as deep vein thrombosis. Additionally, Daniele is interested in understanding the behaviour of cells cultivated on biocompatible soft materials presenting custom stiffness pattern that we fabricated. He is also interested in studying dynamics phenomena developing close to soft interfaces (e.g., liquid-liquid or close to elastic materials) and to understand their implication. To do so he exploits lab-on-a-chip devices with which he is able to precisely control the microenvironment conditions and to design and realize functionalised advanced biocompatible materials.
Daniele Vigolo is a Senior Lecturer in the School of Biomedical Engineering. He received his Laurea (i.e., 5-year Master course) in Nuclear Engineering at the Politecnico di Milano, Italy, in 2006. At the same institution, in 2010, he got his Ph.D. in Radiation Science and Technology working on “Thermophoresis in complex fluids” under the supervision of Prof. Roberto Piazza. He investigated the behaviour of colloidal suspensions in a temperature gradient with optical methods, and in microfluidic devices during his internship at Harvard University in the group of Prof. Howard A. Stone.
In 2011, he moved to Princeton University working as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Complex Fluids Group of Prof. Howard A. Stone. Here he worked on an experimental and theoretical fluid mechanical investigation of particle-wall impacts and air-bubble behaviour at a T-junction. He also developed a microfluidic microbial fuel cell and investigated the dependence of the electric output on the shear stress induced by the flow. In December 2012 he joined the group of Professor Andrew deMello at ETH Zürich after been awarded the ETH Postdoctoral Fellowship (Marie Curie Actions).
In July 2015 he joined the School of Chemical Engineering at the University of Birmingham as a Lecturer and in August 2019 he has been promoted to Senior Lecturer. Daniele was also a staff member of the Healthcare Technologies Institute (HTI). At the University of Birmingham he supervised 9 PhD students and 2 postdocs working on a variety of topics including: mechanism of formation of deep veins thrombosis, generation of biocompatible functional material by microfluidic manipulation of multiphase flows, study of rheological properties of foam and generation of nanobubbles via microfluidics, encapsulation of microbes in double-emulsions generated by microfluidics and their thermal treatment in food applications, dynamics of surfactants during single droplet formation in microfluidics, the implementation of biosensors within contact lenses, and microfluidic approach for microparticle formation of lignocellulosic extracts of plant material via antisolvent processing.
Daniele currently holds an honorary position at the University of Birmingham. Finally, Daniele joined the School of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Sydney as a senior lecturer on September 2020.

Professor Name: Branka VUCETIC
=====================================================================================================
Professor Branka Vucetic's work aims to develop theoretical framework and design principles for wireless communication systems. She is an internationally recognised expert in coding theory and its applications in wireless engineering. Professor Vucetic has held various research and academic positions in the UK, Yugoslavia and Australia, and since 1986 she has been with the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Sydney University, where she is currently Laureate Professor and Director of the Centre of Excellence in Telecommunications.
Her research interests include wireless communications, digital communication theory, error control coding and multi-user detection. Prof Vucetic published four books and more than three hundred papers in telecommunications journals and conference proceedings.
She is a Fellow to the Australian Academy of Science (AAS), Fellow of Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (ATSE), a Chinese Government Friendship Award recipient, an IEEE Fellow and a former Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Communications. In the last several years she has managed several projects related to wireless communications networks development, addressing the issues like interference cancellation, multiple antenna signal processing and coding as well as multiple access technologies.
Her current research activities are focused on advances in wireless networks and internet of things. With the rapidly growing mobile services, there has been an ever increasing demand for very high wireless transmission data rates up to tens-of-Gigabits/second. The conventional microwave bands below 6 GHz have already been heavily utilized and cannot meet this demand. However, the higher millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency band, ranging from 30GHz to 300GHz, offers large bands of unused spectrum and can potentially form the basis for the next revolution in wireless communications. The availability of tens GHz bandwidth in the mmWave band brings the possibility of developing hundreds Gbps data-rate wireless networks. She is working with her team on developing a fundamental theoretical framework and advanced signal processing and network protocols for mmWave systems.
In the area of internet of things, her focus has been on providing wireless connectivity for mission critical applications, where ultralow latency and ultrahigh reliability are essential. Examples are automated power grids, information exchange between vehicles and supporting cloud infrastructure for detecting safety-critical situations, such as black ice, vehicle accident minimisation and adaptation to road conditions, remotely controlled and self-driven vehicles and remote robot-assisted surgeries. She is developing with her team analytical limits and criteria, and applying them to develop novel wireless communication methods and protocols at multiple layers of communication networks that will meet the stringent technical requirements for ultralow latency and ultrahigh reliability of mission-critical applications. A further issue that she is addressing is developing wireless power transfer systems for delivering energy to communication devices by micro and mmWave radiation. This provides communication nodes practically unlimited battery lives and eliminates the need for power cables and chargers. The focus is on creating sharp radio beams, which will have powers high enough to withstand propagation losses and deliver a considerable power to the communication devices and sensor receivers. The applications will be in large scale deployment of wireless sensor networks and commercial IoT applications, currently limited by short lifetime of batteries powering sensors and communication devices.

His research is focused on developing membrane materials and innovative solutions to challenging industrial gas separations using membranes as the core technology platform. He currently lead an ARC discovery project investigating a world’s first interfacial diffusion membrane capable of providing exclusive gas selectivity. This method resulted in a remarkable membrane performance for the separation of CO

(>5500) gases. This has redefined the known selectivity-permeability trade-off of the state-of-the-art polymeric membranes (
Journal of Membrane Science, 2022, 655, 120596
;
Advanced Materials Interfaces, 2019, 6, 1801273
;

). These outcomes open up new opportunities for development of new nanostructure membrane interfaces with exciting new separation processes.
He has also developed for the first time the Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP) technology for tubular inorganic membranes and hollow fibers fabrication, which has led to more than 20 high quality publications and 3 book chapters. The use of RTP for consolidating complex thin films and nanostructures quickly, is an emerging approach for inorganic membranes that will revolutionize inorganic membrane research for a vast range of separation applications. Moreover, the new sol-gel/RTP technique produced the world’s first RTP-derived, single atom catalyst which have led to the successful transfer of catalytic membrane reactors while reducing the processing time by more than 95% (
Chemical Engineering Journal, 2022, 432, 134435
;
Applied Catalysis B:Environmental, 2020, 262, 118246
). This was considered impossible until recently.
Dr David Wang's research aims to offer material solutions for energy-efficient separation and GHG mitigation through low-pressure membrane separation systems, as well as for water purification of complex mixtures using integrated oxidation-membrane processes. He has published 5 book chapters and over 80 scientific research articles featured in Journal of Membrane Science, Chemical Engineering Journal and Environmental Science.
He is currently serving as an International Scientific Committee member for International Conference on Inorganic Membranes, Editorial Board members of Nature's
Scientific Reports
and

Professor Name: Zhiyong WANG
=====================================================================================================
Most of us take the ability to see, hear, and create for granted, but these are very challenging things to enable a computer to do. The dual focuses of Professor Zhiyong Wang's research are to enable computers to 'understand' multimedia data in the way humans can, and to help people better create multimedia content. In this way he is working to improve applications in fields as diverse as multimedia information retrieval, computer vision, computer graphics and animation, multimedia analytics, precision agriculture, environmental monitoring, medical diagnosis, and healthcare.
"Multimedia computing is a fascinating field with a broad range of applications. We capture the very moments of our daily life in photos and videos, doctors use various medical images to make diagnoses, and astronomers use images of the sky to study the universe. Without multimedia computing techniques, all this would be impossible.
"Such technology allows us to create content such as computer animations, special effects and 3D movies, digital human, and metaverse much more easily and creatively than traditional approaches.
"One of the aims of my research is to enable computers to 'understand' multimedia data. This will mean, for example, that they will be able to ascertain how people are behaving physically (from action recognition) and emotionally (from facial expression recognition). This will allow better video analytics, disease identification, multimedia-enabled training and monitoring, and computer graphics and animation.
"Being with the University of Sydney has provided me a great platform to pursue my research interests, and allowed me to closely link my research with a variety of disciplines. It has been my greatest pleasure to work with the intellectually inspiring students."
Zhiyong Wang is a Professor at the School of Computer Science and the Director of Multimedia Computing Laboratory. His research on multimedia computing is at the intersection of information retrieval, computing vision, computer graphics, and AI (Artificial Intelligence). His research interests focus on multimedia information retrieval, multimedia content understanding (e.g., human action recognition), and multimedia content creation, human-centred multimedia computing, remote sensing, and inter-disciplinary applications in various domains such as agriculture, earth observation, environment, health, and medicine. His research outcomes have been widely published in top conferences and journals and resulted in practical impact in real world applications. He received both a B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in electronic engineering from the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, and a Ph.D. degree from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong. He was the President of Australia Pattern Recognition Soceity (APRS) and is a member of IEEE.

Professor Name: Li WEI
=====================================================================================================
Nanomaterials - those manufactured at scales 10,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair - are valued for their unique properties, which can offer exceptional performance in a wide range of applications. Dr Li Wei is developing new methods of manufacturing these remarkable materials, with the aim of translating the resulting properties into practical applications for a greener future.
"My research focuses on developing novel methods of achieving control over the assembly of materials at nanoscale, which can grant such materials exceptional properties for use in a range of energy-related applications.
"One example is the splitting of water molecules to produce hydrogen gas for use as a clean fuel.
"The burning of hydrogen can produce large amounts of heat or generate large amounts of electricity. But the industrial electrolysis cells currently used to produce hydrogen use expensive platinum as the catalyst, hindering our access to cheap hydrogen sources.
"So I am looking at how we can produce hydrogen more cheaply, through a process that results in only water as a by-product, eliminating the release of greenhouse gases and other hazardous by-products generated in the burning of fossil fuels.
"Within the next few years I'm hoping to develop prototype electrolysis cells to realise the pilot-scale production of cheap hydrogen gas as a clean fuel source. This will not only provide an economical fuel source but also reduce the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere and so address climate-related concerns.
"Another example of my research is the synthesis and separation of single-walled carbon nanotubes - hollow carbon tubes with a diameter 10,000 times narrower than human hair but with electric conductivity 100 times higher than silver. They can be used to fabricate transistors, which are essential components of modern electronic devices.
"I hope my research can make some important contributions to realising the superior properties of nanomaterials, particularly in the efficient production of cheap and renewable 'green' fuels, to create a more sustainable human society.
"I have been working in this field for 10 years, and I joined the University in 2016. The University offers me great academic freedom and a unique multidisciplinary research environment in which to develop my intellectual capabilities and creativity."

Professor Name: Tim WILKINSON
=====================================================================================================
Associate Professor Tim Wilkinson's research into the behaviour of steel structural components is leading to the design of more efficient and economical buildings, bridges and other structures. As Associate Dean (Student Life) of the Faculty of Engineering, he also has a strong interest in improving teaching and learning outcomes in engineering.
"Structural steel is used as the 'skeleton' that supports buildings and bridges. Columns and beams of steel are held together with connections made from bolts and welds, and we need to ensure that these components and the connections between them do not buckle or break. As technology advances we are increasingly able to make thinner and stronger steel beams, but this can sometime induce new and different types of buckles to develop.
"My research considers how new shapes and strengths of steel beams will behave. Will they buckle in the same way as older, thicker beams, or do we need to consider new types of failure that we must avoid?
"Some of my work is carried out in our structures laboratory, using hydraulic machines that can place heavy loads onto beams and columns to simulate what they experience in a real building or bridge. I record how they behave under these loads, and then analyse these results on a computer.
"My research allows me to use a combination of engineering knowledge, mathematical skills and common sense to find solutions to engineering challenges, but it's my teaching that gets me most excited.
"I've taught more than 2000 civil engineering students over the past 20 years, and those students have gone on to design and build hundreds of buildings, bridges, roads and tunnels. I like to think that I've had an influence on them and given them some of the theoretical and practical grounding that has enabled them to become so successful."

Professor Name: Stefan WILLIAMS
=====================================================================================================
Professor Stefan Williams' research in the field of marine robotics is enhancing our ability to document, understand and thus protect our deep-water marine habitats. His current focus is on the development and deployment of autonomous underwater vehicles whose visual and acoustic sensors can gather data for the purpose of generating high-resolution 3D models of underwater marine environments.
"My research focuses mainly on the development of techniques for high-resolution mapping of marine habitats. This work uses a combination of visual and acoustic sensors to generate detailed, three-dimensional models of underwater environments using data collected by autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs).
"These AUV surveys are designed to collect high-resolution stereo imagery and oceanographic data to support studies in the fields of engineering science, ecology, biology, geoscience, archaeology and industrial applications.
"My recent work has focused on generating high-fidelity, three-dimensional models of the seafloor; precisely matching survey locations across years to allow scientists to understand variability in these environments; and identifying patterns in the data that facilitate automated classification of the resulting image sets.
"Insights gained from this work have been used, for example, to better understand the recovery of coral reefs from bleaching and cyclones, as well as the behaviour of temperate reef organisms such as fish, urchins and lobsters.
"My colleagues and I conduct these AUV-based surveys around Australia and internationally. We are currently undertaking arguably the world's first benthic (sea-floor) observing program to make extensive use of AUVs for the purpose of monitoring benthic habitats on such a large scale.
"I am particularly passionate about this area of research because it allows me to interact with such a dynamic group of peers in helping to document and understand marine habitats. Seeing our robotic systems and sensor systems being deployed on sensitive coral reefs, deep-water hydrothermal vent systems and temperate kelp forests is immensely satisfying, and is helping to change our understanding of the marine environment."

Professor Name: Anusha WITHANA
=====================================================================================================
As wearable devices such as smartwatches and fitness trackers become increasingly ubiquitous, Dr Anusha Withana's research seeks to create a new generation of highly personalised wearable devices and technologies that will blend in with the human body. These devices will play an important role in supporting the demands of future digital societies in a wide range of social applications, including health care, aged care and education.
"The human body and its close vicinity is the most intimate and personal space for any individual, and everybody is unique in their physicality, their preferences and their needs. Wearable devices, which are designed to work in this space, therefore not only need to be non-intrusive and accommodating, but also should support great flexibility in personalisation. Unfortunately, commercially available devices currently do not support such a degree of freedom in customisation of design, applications or interactions. This is what my research aims to address.
"My research uses advances in material sciences, functional materials and personal fabrication, along with inspiration from nature (biomimicry), to create wearable interfaces that do not require user attention, use very little power, and are customisable according to user preferences in functionality as well as appearance.
"My long-term goal is to create the ultimate wearable interface that works as an extension of human body, so that the user will not need to be aware of it - charge it, turn it on and off, worry about privacy issues - but rather it will just blend in with the user's body, senses and expressions, becoming transparent to the user."
Dr Anusha Withana is a lecturer in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) in the School of Computer Science, University of Sydney. His primary research focus is in developing devices that integrate a user’s body with the environment (blended interfaces). Prior to joining University of Sydney, he was a postdoctoral research fellow at the Saarland University and the Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Germany. He completed his PhD (2014) on the topic “Integration of multimodal interactions for Inter-Spatial Continuum” at Keio University, Japan under the supervision of Prof. Masahiko Inami. He has received a Masters in Media Design (2010) from Keio University and BSc (Hons.) in electronics engineering (2007) from University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.

Professor Name: Mike WU
=====================================================================================================
Mike's research aims to center on clarifying the major players and mechanisms contributing to the non-reflow phenomenon in small vessels in cardiovascular ischemic diseases. This is achieved through the utilization of powerful animal models, high-end confocal imaging, and immunostaining techniques. Specifically, his focus areas include delineating the role of dying platelets in triggering remote organ injury following the initial ischemic insult, as well as investigating the novel mechanism(s) obstructing microvasculature via erythrocytes and dying endothelium in SARS-CoV-2 infected and ischemia reperfusion injured patients. Additionally, Mike's research also encompasses the discovery of the next generation of anti-coagulants with a safer bleeding profile for stroke treatment. Building on his expertise in animal models and the discovery of new occluding mechanisms, he plans to expand his research to develop new diagnostic tools for identifying potential thrombosis risks in individuals who have not exhibited any symptoms.
Furthermore, Mike aims to publish his findings in high-impact journals in the fields of hematology and immunology. To date, he has already published his work in PNAS, Nature Communications, and Science Translational Medicine.
Mike (Chia Lun) is a senior research fellow at the Heart Research Institute and Charles Perkins Centre at the University of Sydney (NSW). He completed his undergraduate Bachelor of Science degree in 2006 and received first-class honors in Biomedical Science in 2008 from Queensland University. In 2013, he completed his doctoral studies in immunopharmacology at the University of Queensland under an Australian Postgraduate Award.
With a vision of translating new therapeutic treatments and medical diagnostic tools, Mike obtained a graduate certificate in research commercialization in 2012 at Queensland University and worked at UniQuest in technology commercialization and patenting activities in 2013. He joined Prof. Shaun Jackson's lab at The Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University in 2013 to enhance understanding of the basic principles of normal hemostasis and its diseases in cardiovascular diseases.
In 2015, Mike joined HRI and, under Prof. Jackson's supervision, led a team to establish animal models, contributing as a first author to a landmark publication in Science Translational Medicine in 2017. In 2016, his research findings and interests laid the foundation for further basic and translational research through collaboration with Prof. Payne at the School of Chemistry, University of Sydney. In 2016, he also contributed to two successful NHMRC project grants (APP1127278 and APP1120941). In 2017, he initiated a small project to understand the pathogenesis of microvascular obstruction in ischemic injury through the University of Sydney Kickstart Grant.
Since 2016, Mike has been liaising with the chemistry team in Sydney University, co-investigating novel drugs for the treatment of stroke, securing funding from the Brain Foundation in 2019, NHF-Vanguard in 2020, and MRFF-TTRA (1012). Currently, his biological team under Prof. Jackson’s supervision, in collaboration with the chemistry team, is working on developing novel anti-coagulants with a significantly safer bleeding profile for the treatment of stroke.

Professor Name: Chang XU
=====================================================================================================
Nowadays, data is increasingly cheap and ubiquitous. The corpuses are too voluminous to fit on a single machine. Meanwhile, the variety of data stands out on its own, as the data often include various data types, such as video, music and text. They are heterogeneity in modality, sources and semantics. On the other hand, they are typically messy, incomplete, and unstructured. Given these challenges, the ability to handle data variety and use it to our advantage is becoming ever more important.
Dr Chang Xu's passion is to devise ways to understand how data variety works and how it can be interrogated and exploited for the broadest possible purposes.
"We humans can intelligently integrate information from their natural senses of vision, hearing, touch and so on to make the decision. This innate ability enables us to confidently interpret our current environment or situation no matter how complex it is.
"A machine can also easily collect diverse information through different sensors or extractors, e.g., colour descriptor, local binary patterns, local shape descriptor and spatial temporal context captured by multiple cameras for human activity understanding in camera network, or the word content of webpage, and the website address and name to distinguish this particular web page before your eyes now.
"How best to describe these heterogeneous data, explore their underlying properties and inner relationships, and leverage them for distinct decision needs excite me about the research.
"I identify significant challenges, provide fundamental theoretical supports, and formulate innovative algorithmic solutions to understand and manipulate data variety. One of my ultimate research aims is allowing machines to intelligently handle multiple information sources like humans.
"I warmly welcome students and peers to collaborate with me in the related research fields to make contributions to the realization of Artificial Intelligence."
Dr Chang Xu is Associate Professor in Machine Learning and Computer Vision at the School of Computer Science, University of Sydney. He obtained a Bachelor of Engineering from Tianjin University, China, and a Ph.D. degree from Peking University, China. While pursing his PhD degree, Chang received fellowships from IBM and Baidu. His research interests lie in machine learning, data mining algorithms and related applications in artificial intelligence and computer vision, including multi-view learning, multi-label learning, visual search and face recognition. His research outcomes have been widely published in prestigious journals and top tier conferences.

Professor Name: Kalina YACEF
=====================================================================================================
Professor Kalina Yacef's research into how humans learn extends well beyond the discipline of education. Her work in the field of human-centred data mining aims to create novel ways of extracting meaning from the vast quantities of human data captured through various types of digital environments - including online systems, wearable devices and interactive tabletops - to detect patterns in human learning and behaviours that will facilitate meaningful, data-driven decisions in a range of applications. Her work has begun attracting attention from other researchers in a wide range of fields.
"Through my research I have developed a number of innovative projects in human-centred data mining, learning analytics, personalised teaching systems and unobtrusive, multimodal capture of learner behaviours.
"This work is now attracting significant interest from colleagues and industry partners both nationally and internationally, particularly in health-related disciplines, for its potential to help us better understand and analyse human behaviour patterns.
"For example, health and exercise researchers increasingly work with accelerometers and similar devices that unobtrusively measure people's activity. Currently, the data captured is far from being exploited to its full potential, as these researchers tend to just extract the kind of high-granularity data they are used to working with, such as total amount of activity per day. I work with them to first understand the kinds of research questions they pursue, and then devise data-mining techniques to reveal new kinds of information, such as the patterns and types of movements people do during the day, and how these evolve over time.
"I like to focus on understanding the needs of my colleagues from other disciplines, and on designing data-mining techniques that will transform the way they do their research and open up new ways of using modern technologies that capture data.
"At the core of all my research is the notion of keeping the human in the loop, and of supporting rather than replacing the experts.
"I joined the University of Sydney in 2000, fresh from my PhD. Its international reputation has helped to drive my international recognition, and it is definitely supporting my industry engagement."
Professor Kalina Yacef graduated in October 1999 with a PhD in Computer Science from the University Paris under a collaboration with CSIRO and Thales Australia. She had previously obtained a Masters in Artificial Intelligence and Bachelor in Mathematics.
She is a founding member of the International Educational Data Mining Society (
IEDMS
) and serves on its Board of Directors, as well as on the Executive Committee of the International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society (
IAIED
). She is Associate Editor of the
IEEE TLT
journal, and Associate Editor (and Founding past Editor-in-Chief) of the Journal of Educational Data Mining (

Professor Name: Yu YAO
=====================================================================================================
"My goal is to make the machine learning systems to be reliable and aligned with human values. This includes the following directions:
Robustness
: How can we build ML systems that are robust to different types of noise in different data modalities? How can we improve ML systems' adaptability to changing environments? How can we design the evaluation methods to existing ML systems in real-world settings?
Interpretable Representation
: How can we explain the representation learned by different ML methods? What would be the necessary assumptions for developing disentangled representations under different cases? How can we use multimodal data together to encourage the disentanglement? What empirical methods are needed to effectively achieve such disentanglement?
Targeting these challenges by combining rigorous theoretical frameworks with empirical insights is notonly provide us with a clearer understanding of ML systems but is necessary if we hope for ML to truly benefit society."

Professor Name: Xiaoke YI
=====================================================================================================
Prof Xiaoke Yi is looking for PhD. students and postdocs.
Professor Xiaoke Yi’s research into nanophotonics and integrated microwave photonics promises to lead to breakthroughs that will meet our ever-increasing demand for information and communication systems that can process high-frequency and wideband signals at lightning speed.
“Microwave photonics is a multidisciplinary field that brings together the worlds of microwave engineering and optoelectronics, for applications in areas such as communications, radars, sensors and instrumentation.
“These applications require ever-increasing speed, bandwidth, sensitivity, functionality and dynamic range. They also need devices that are small and lightweight and have low power consumption, strong immunity to electromagnetic interference and high mobility.
“Currently digital electronic circuits are the most widely used approaches for these applications; however, the sampling speed of digital electronic is normally less than several gigahertz. The unique capabilities of photonics for processing ultrawide bandwidth, where high-frequency microwave signals are only a tiny fraction of the carrier’s optical frequency, make it a promising solution to meet our ever-increasing demand for expanding the capacity of information and communication systems and networks.
“My vision is to deliver major breakthroughs in signal processing and sensing that will bring about disruptive changes in fields such as communications, defence and healthcare delivery.
“For example, I am currently working on a non-invasive sensing technique for glucose monitoring in people with diabetes that is highly accurate, fast (real-time), low-cost, pain-free and risk-free. This represents a major breakthrough in the development of non-invasive blood glucose measurement devices that can provide stable and reliable results, conveniently and economically.
“I first encountered fibre optics during my PhD, when I started to explore using light for signal processing. Since joining the University of Sydney more than 10 years ago I’ve continued to pursue my passion in photonic signal processing, and have driven this field from concepts to discrete components to integration circuits and functional subsystems.
“Here I am surrounded by amazing colleagues who are passionate about their research and about new technologies, and my research benefits from this supportive and collaborative environment.
“The University’s recent $150 million investment in establishing the world-leading Australian Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology also shows its commitment to a major research focus on nanoscale science and its applications.”

Professor Name: Hao ZHANG
=====================================================================================================
Earthquakes, cyclones, floods and tsunamis are events of low probability but high consequences. Associate Professor Hao Zhang's research looks at the frequency and magnitude of such events, and at their effects on structures such as buildings and bridges, with the aim of increasing safety by improving design.
"We cannot eliminate earthquakes, cyclones and so on. They will happen. But in terms of our structures, we can be prepared.
"It's not possible to design a structure that is absolutely safe - one that will never fail - but we can certainly mitigate the risks so that, for example, if a major earthquake does occur, the people inside will be able to get out.
"I always wanted to be a structural engineer. My parents were both mechanical engineers, so I was familiar with engineering generally, but as a kid I decided I wanted to build something big, so I went into civil engineering!
"I worked in industry before entering academia, which means I appreciate the challenges and responsibilities of being a civil engineer. I wanted to gain this experience before becoming a researcher. Otherwise I felt that I would be doing research into, for example, building better bridges but would never have designed one myself.
"I joined the University of Sydney in 2008, and am very happy to have moved here. I can choose what I want to research, and the School of Civil Engineering provides me with a lot of support, including funding, student resources and opportunities to collaborate with colleagues and industry. I really enjoy working in this environment."

Professor Name: Luping ZHOU
=====================================================================================================
The advent of medical imaging techniques such as CT and MRI scans has significantly reshaped modern medical research and practice, transforming hospital diagnostic and treatment protocols. Dr Luping Zhou's research in computer-assisted medical image analysis aims to enhance the efficacy of these tools along with associated patient outcomes.
"Computer-assisted automatic processing and analysis of medical images is in high demand, due to its better precision, repeatability and objectivity for diagnosis. The associated research is known as medical image analysis.
"One of my current research focuses is to improve the early prediction of mental diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (which is the second-leading cause of death in Australia), using imaging-based bio-markers automatically identified from brain images.
"In general my research focuses on significant problems that are of both scientific and commercial interests, such as the early diagnosis of multiple mental disorders (including Alzheimer's disease, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia), image-guided radiation therapy for prostate cancer, automatic cell image classification (for the diagnosis of some autoimmune diseases), and brain tumour segmentation (for brain cancer staging).
"Medical image analysis is a good combination of my interests in computer science and in helping people to live healthy lives. My first job was in a company that built virtual reality systems for surgical training and planning. I found that was exactly what I want to do in my life, so I went back to university to complete a PhD in that area.
"My ultimate research goal is to automate medical image analysis with artificial intelligence, resulting in automatically generated radiology and other medical imaging reports.
"I've now been working in the field of medical image analysis for more than 12 years, in both industry and academia, and I joined the University of Sydney in 2017. The school here has a strong team in image analysis and biomedical engineering, and a long history of collaboration with hospitals. These factors will greatly benefit my future research."
Dr Luping Zhou is an Associate Professor and a previous ARC DECRA Fellow in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Sydney, Australia. Prior to this, she was a Senior Lecturer at the University of Wollongong, where she maintains an honorary position.

Professor Name: Albert ZOMAYA
=====================================================================================================
Many of us are aware that technologies such as internet banking, Facebook and web-based email systems store our details in a massive distributed computing environment known as a ‘cloud’. But few of us fully appreciate the pervasiveness of such technology in our everyday lives. As Director of the Centre for Distributed and High-Performance Computing, Professor Albert Zomaya’s research is advancing the development of these computing technologies that support a vast range of everyday technologies and services.
“Parallel and distributed computing technology today is so pervasive that its influence penetrates our daily lives in ways that were not experienced in the past.
“In essence, a parallel and distributed computer distributes computation, storage or both across many processors. This technology is present in a wide range of devices and systems, from mobile phones to desktop computers to data clouds to the World Wide Web.
“Distributed and high-performance computing technologies have applications in security – including nuclear testing, gas dispersion and cryptography – as well as in the manufacturing of motor vehicles, aeroplanes and space shuttles. They are also very important for many biomedical and bioinformatics applications including gene sequencing and radiation treatment planning. And they play a vital and rapidly growing role in the production of motion pictures and of everyday products including toothpaste tubes, chemicals containers and even potato chips.
“These technologies are therefore not only crucial for our national security but essential to the development of cost-efficient products that improve our national productivity and economic competitiveness.
“I’ve been working in this field for more than 20 years, and have been with the University of Sydney since 2002. Being here has provided me with more opportunities for industry engagement and outreach, as well as opportunities to attract very good PhD students.”
